		"as i was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils mrs fairfax called to me your morning school hours are over now i suppose said she",
		"miss ingram rose solemnly i go first she said in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope mounting a breach in the van of his men",
		"give the tray to me i will carry it in",
		"i filled the interval in walking softly about my room and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent",
		"he rang and despatched an invitation to mrs fairfax who soon arrived knitting basket in hand",
		"i have worn it since the day i lost my only treasure as a memento of her",
		"ah",
		"eliza surveyed her parent calmly",
		"yes he did not stay many minutes in the house missis was very high with him she called him afterwards a sneaking tradesman",

		"one day however as she put away her account book and unfolded her embroidery she suddenly took her up thus georgiana a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth",
		"but jane will give me her love yes nobly generously",
		"i now ventured to descend it was deep dusk i retired into a corner and sat down on the floor",
		"grace poole you have guessed it",
		"i pronounced his name offering him at the same time my hand he took it smiling and saying we shall do very well by and by",
		"first then tell me what you have been accustomed to do and what you can do",
		"the church as the reader knows was but just beyond the gates the footman soon returned",
		"do you wonder that i avow this to you",
		"no sir she has sent her coachman",
		"i went up to her and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand",
		"and the clergyman who had not lifted his eyes from his book and had held his breath but for a moment was proceeding his hand was already stretched towards mr rochester as his lips unclosed to ask wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife",
		"was anybody stirring below when you went down jane",
		"i will not pause either to accuse or repine",
		"in that sense i do feel apprehensive i have no wish to talk nonsense",
		"but i cannot persuade her to go away my lady said the footman nor can any of the servants mrs fairfax is with her just now entreating her to be gone but she has taken a chair in the chimney corner and says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here",
		"you fell sick i suppose in the red room with crying you ll be better soon no doubt",
		"exclaimed miss scatcherd nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits carry the rod away",
		"here then i was in the third storey fastened into one of its mystic cells night around me a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door yes that was appalling the rest i could bear but i shuddered at the thought of grace poole bursting out upon me",
		"that night after he had kissed his sisters he thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me but left the room in silence",
		"he threw the letter into her lap",
		"my heart beat fast and thick i heard its throb",
		"tell me that",
		"but bobby preferred sidling over to his mother",
		"he was silent after i had uttered the last sentence and i presently risked an upward glance at his countenance",
		"yes yes yes",
		"i wonder what they thought",
		"though i had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed i could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue and told how his destiny had risen up before him and dared him to be happy at thornfield",
		"the more solitary the more friendless the more unsustained i am the more i will respect myself",
		"sacrifice",
		"the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice",
		"mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last",
		"and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock",
		"mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps",
		"but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical",
		"they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit",
		"they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long",
		"she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false",
		"i speak feelingly",
		"more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy",
		"as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was",
		"and poor mr darcy",
		"it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it",
		"to put me on my guard",
		"the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words",
		"one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe",
		"he heard her with astonishment",
		"he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us",
		"it must be an amusing study yes but intricate characters are the most amusing",
		"though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced",
		"well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband",
		"poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful",
		"it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds",
		"but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence",
		"mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself",
		"this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it",
		"mr darcy is engaged to my daughter",
		"he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments",
		"he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there",
		"i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley",
		"his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go",
		"his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her",
		"when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention",
		"she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when",
		"but i tell you miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead",
		"you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas",
		"wickham passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed",
		"his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion",
		"there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake",
		"however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters",
		"but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it",
		"they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day",
		"but lizzy",
		"on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband",
		"i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned",
		"he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily",
		"and for this we are to be thankful",
		"it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of",
		"no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy",
		"i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word",
		"elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance",
		"their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them",
		"his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal",
		"she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost",
		"jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news what news",
		"no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting",
		"from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed",
		"i am so pleased so happy",
		"i am not equal to it",
		"oh no but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next day she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham",
		"i must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks",
		"i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first",
		"her hair so untidy so blowsy yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me",
		"the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth",
		"he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend",
		"he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn",
		"i am not qualified to form one",
		"she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not the courage for it",
		"after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped",
		"mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card",
		"if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman",
		"the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them",
		"every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected",
		"your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together",
		"what do you keep winking at me for",
		"i told my sister phillips so the other day",
		"elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible",
		"upon my word",
		"at length the parsonage was discernible",
		"she was of great use and comfort to us all",
		"had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd",
		"the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow",
		"elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long",
		"mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton",
		"every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time",
		"with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected",
		"when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingley",
		"he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way",
		"mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection",
		"elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend",
		"but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years",
		"this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage",
		"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak",
		"the country is a vast deal pleasanter is it not mr bingley when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same",
		"whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy",
		"you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised",
		"such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house",
		"sir william had been delighted with him",
		"if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better",
		"do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends",
		"i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case",
		"nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related",
		"so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great",
		"at length she spoke again",
		"kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do",
		"mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves",
		"can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable",
		"imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me exceed their income",
		"the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more",
		"even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia",
		"many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man",
		"he addressed himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation",
		"i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose good god",
		"it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world",
		"but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking",
		"if i could but see you as happy",
		"no but it must be done soon most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote",
		"you do not blame me however for refusing him blame you",
		"the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay",
		"think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind",
		"the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth",
		"the son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for",
		"she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so",
		"after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer",
		"she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him",
		"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single it is no such thing",
		"yet now i must believe you cried jane",
		"choose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way",
		"only think",
		"and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead",
		"yes if darcy does not put it off again",
		"he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride",
		"his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret",
		"but you do not know all",
		"it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road",
		"if this be the case he deserves you",
		"it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer",
		"it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy",
		"what would she have said",
		"the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this",
		"miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him",

		"she replied that she believed she had and praised his horsemanship",
		"she added i am not so difficult a person",
		"cried the general",
		"i was saying my self respect as my wife s pensioner my lady",
		"she shall be she will dear madam",
		"we might try absence for the poor girl",
		"had she kept her back to him he might have rounded her like the shadow of a dial undetected",
		"and where did you ride",
		"i am a widow as you know",
		"where was your consideration for elizabeth then",
		"he did not see how he could have escaped doing so he was more an agent than a principal",
		"general ople started admitted that the word was french and apologized for his pronunciation",
		"those who made a hero of him were sure he would treat her with disdain",
		"the business we have to discuss concerns the young people general",
		"why do you mean to tell me that you would have cared for those drawings of mine when marching",
		"they came fast and thick",
		"not a doubt could exist as to the person it was meant to be",
		"his fingers were not so confident for he tore one of the letters to open it",
		"and there you see this is what she has done",
		"i want to be just",
		"lady camper is indeed a most eccentric person",
		"i said the general i say i feel my poor half pay having always been a working soldier myself very important i was saying very important to me",
		"now consider the general s feelings when turning to this fourth page having these very words in his mouth as the accurate expression of his thoughts he discovered them written",
		"young rolles whom he had met now and then persisted in praising his aunt s good heart",
		"i certainly shall never chase reginald out of mine",
		"the young man fell into a dramatic tearing of hair and long stride fury not ill becoming an enamoured dragoon",
		"said elizabeth",
		"but you see i have no means of escape i am at her mercy from morning to night the general said with a quivering tongue unless i stay at home inside the house and that is death to me or unless i abandon the place and my lease and i shall i say i shall find nowhere in england for anything like the money or conveniences such a gent a residence you would call fit for a gentleman",
		"though but a few minutes back he had shown her the contents of the packet including a hurried glance of the famous digging scene",
		"so attentive was she to elizabeth that the general had it kindly suggested to him that some one was courting him through his daughter",
		"but what kind of creature",
		"she would perhaps after the excitement admit his masculine superiority in the beautiful old fashion by fainting in his arms",
		"to meet",
		"so it was with general ople and nothing is left for me to say except that there is broader ground than the chessboard",
		"still albeit not gifted with imagination he could not avoid the feeling that he had set his face to winter",
		"lady camper sighed dejectedly",
		"she had passed a rather restless night she said",
		"i have a little overstated it but i am near the mark",
		"the sole inhabitant contemplates his largely substantial full fleshed face and figure in a glass",
		"no",
		"my lady the general interposed i have her distinct assurance that it is i say it is wrapt up in mine",
		"there i have done",
		"she said to her great people and they submitted with the best grace in the world while the general s ears tingled till he felt younger than reginald",
		"conversing with her in the privacy of domestic life would never be the flowing business that it is for other men",
		"the smile was meant for propitiation and sweetness",
		"the general flashed out in a radiance that dulled instantly",
		"of his neighbours generally mrs baerens the wife of a german merchant an exquisite player on the pianoforte was the most inclined to lead him to speak of lady camper",
		"he made the following odd confession to mr and mrs gosling on the road that he had gone to his chest and taken out his sword belt to measure his girth and found himself thinner than when he left the service which had not been the case before his attendance at the last levee of the foregoing season",
		"no man should ever say it",
		"she has every quality of a good wife",
		"i thought i had heard of a widow barcop in this parish",
		"you english have the smallest experience of humanity",
		"he could remember only the gentlemanly residence",
		"so we need not marvel that his acquaintances should suppose him to be secretly aware of an extreme degree in which lady camper was a veteran",
		"reginald stretched his hand for the privileged flower and she let him take it then she looked at the general but the general was looking with his usual air of satisfaction nowhere",
		"if you have not much money to spare for her according to your prudent calculation reflect how this money has enfeebled you and reduced you to the level of the people round about us here who are what",
		"the great lady stood a moment beside mrs baerens she came straight over to him contemplating him in silence",
		"but you must be positive of victory otherwise with the river behind you your new position is likely to be ticklish",
		"he forbore to mention her age for he was the most honourable of men but a habit of tea table talkativeness impelled him to say and repeat an idea that had visited him to the effect that lady camper was one of those wonderful women who are comparable to brilliant generals and defend themselves from the siege of time by various aggressive movements",
		"lady camper s return was the subject of speculation in the neighbourhood for most people thought she would cease to persecute the general with her preposterous and unwarrantable pen and ink sketches when living so closely proximate and how he would behave was the question",
		"and he tacitly with the absurdest of smiles begged permission to leave unterminated a sentence not in itself particularly difficult i have a nose observed lady camper",
		"they asked him where elizabeth was and he replied poor child yes",
		"and by the way you have a leaning for widows",
		"they in truth show her to us discreet civilized in a decent moral aspect vistas of real life views of the mind s eye are opened by their touching little emotions whereas those bully youngsters who come bellowing at us and catch us by the senses plainly prove either that we are no better than they or that we give our attention to nature only when she makes us afraid of her",
		"lady camper remarked of her she seems honest and that is the most we can hope of girls",
		"this is a new idea to me my dear general she said",
		"he was pained to think of her misfortune but as she was not over forty the disaster was perhaps not irremediable that is to say if she could be taught to extend her forgiveness to men and abandon her solitude",
		"i wish you success",
		"you hear old gentlemen speak fondly of the swish and they are not attached to pain but the instrument revives their feeling of youth and general ople half enjoyed while shrinking lady camper s foregone outlines of him",
		"such was the reverie he passingly indulged and only so could he venture to hope for an acquaintance with the formidable lady who was his next neighbour",
		"she dreaded to hear of something gentlemanly",
		"my lawyer says it",
		"how is the general",
		"poor child",
		"to continue said lady camper i never have liked early marriages",
		"but when i found you on closer acquaintance as indifferent to your daughter s happiness as you had been to her reputation",
		"i would rather they should not i do not hold it good for young soldiers to marry",
		"she spoke of money",
		"it was almost a paroxysm",
		"elizabeth stretched a finger at arm s length issuing directions which mr rolles took up and worded further to the man for the sake of emphasis and he rather than elizabeth was guilty of the half start at sight of the persons who were approaching",
		"but i insist that a settlement be made on her before i give my nephew one penny",
		"so the deduction was obvious that lady camper had reduced him",
		"by this time the entire district was in fervid sympathy with general ople",
		"for her ladyship had proved acutely nipping",
		"and at one time her not condescending to exchange visits with the obsequious general was a topic fertile in irony",
		"at all hours",
		"if he said to his daughter lady camper should by any chance be induced to contract a second alliance she would one might expect be humanized and we should have highly agreeable neighbours",
		"why did you retire",
		"general ople assisted lady camper to alight from the carriage which was forthwith despatched for elizabeth",
		"quite an extraordinary circumstance with such a wife",
		"she is an upright woman and i must be the same",
		"her happiness",
		"this one illustrated wilsonople s courtship of the moon and ended with his saying in his peculiar manner in spite of her paint i could not have conceived her age to be so enormous",
		"general ople trembled with protestant indignation when he saw himself reclining in a magnified sentry box while detachments of shadows hurry to him to show him the standard of his country trailing in the dust and he is maliciously made to say i dislike responsibility",
		"you take to her my dear",
		"you would not have cared one bit for a caricature if you had not nursed the absurd idea of being one of our conquerors",
		"sufficient he assured her for a gentlemanly appearance",
		"none she replied",
		"the general said",
		"and he was one and though modest he was in good humour with himself approved himself and could say that without boasting of success he was a satisfied man until he met his touchstone in lady camper",
		"bring good sense with you when you do come",
		"she always admires you on horseback",
		"now the end of such meetings is marriage and the sooner the better if they are to continue",
		"do not be hurt if i decide that we had better remain as we are",
		"but when we see our veterans tottering to their fall we scarcely consent to their having a wish as for a kiss we halloo at them if we discover them on a byway to the sacred grove where such things are supposed to be done by the venerable",
		"you must get a militia regiment or inspectorship of militia",
		"ah cried lady camper do not use these vulgar contractions of decent speech in my presence",
		"you desire to settle our business first",
		"but between watching an orb that is only variable at our caprice and contemplating a woman who shifts and quivers ever with her own how vast the difference",
		"now listen to me and do not exclaim until i have finished",
		"lady camper surprised him by answering his thoughts",
		"he assured everybody that lady camper was much misunderstood she was a most remarkable woman she was a most affable and highly intelligent lady",
		"a gentlemanly humility or demureness of aspect when seen would he hoped disarm his enemy",
		"if then nature is in it how has she been made active",
		"general ople was very anxious to see her",
		"i freckle so easily she repeated dropping her parasol to defend her face from the calculating scrutiny",
		"but lady camper could not quit her pew owing to the sticking of the door",
		"well general you were fond of thinking of yourself and i thought i would assist you",
		"hem",
		"he was perfectly concealed from the road",
		"mrs baerens a lady of teutonic extraction was distinguishable as of that sex at least she was not masculine",
		"pray do not be dismayed general",
		"to call a lady of seventy angela is difficult in itself",
		"i am impatient yes general impatient for what forgiveness",
		"building up her attributes on a splendid climax he declared she was pious charitable witty and really an extraordinary artist",
		"before he could rally his wits to answer the question he was asked and what have you done with your necktie and collar",
		"he told elizabeth that night he really must begin to think of marrying her to some worthy young fellow",
		"how can i speak it papa",
		"he had to wait a fortnight before one came and that was rather a likeness and a handsome likeness except as regarded a certain disorderliness in his dress which he knew to be very unlike him",
		"we have named them if that advances us",
		"what else can i do child",
		"are you not coming general",
		"it recurred at another mention of his idea of the nature of the residence",
		"said he startling himself with an abhorrent dream of envy of those enriched invading officers for booty is the one lovely thing which the military mind can contemplate in the abstract",
		"he pulled the door gave the shadow of a respectful bow and no doubt he would have withdrawn had not lady camper while acknowledging the civility placed her prayer book in his hands to carry at her heels",
		"he talked of it incessantly but forbore to tell elizabeth as she was looking pale the reason why its modest merits touched him so",
		"elizabeth shall have half my money settled on her said the general though i fear it is not much",
		"you have a gentlemanly residence",
		"she said you will not need to bring property of any kind to the common estate i neither look for it nor desire it",
		"the astronomer looking at the crusty jag and scoria of the magnified moon through his telescope and again with naked eyes at the soft beaming moon when the crater ridges are faint as eyebrow pencillings has a similar sharp alternation of prospect to that which mystified general ople",
		"general ople was really forced by his manly dignity to make this protest on its behalf",
		"i will not say i meant to work a homoeopathic cure",
		"he was drawing backward as he said it and something provoked her to smile",
		"you are aware of the smallness of a subaltern s pay",
		"now this and not the series representing the martyrdom of the old couple at douro lodge gates whose rigid frames bore witness to the close packing of a gentlemanly residence this was the sketch general ople in his madness from the pursuing bite of the gadfly handed about at mrs pollington s lawn party",
		"you can give yourself the airs of wealth buy horses to conceal your nakedness and when you are taken upon the standard of your apparent income you would rather seem to be beating a miserly retreat than behave frankly and honestly",
		"she had changed",
		"general ople understood her last remark",
		"the ladies did not as their lords did proclaim astonishment that a man should suffer a woman to goad him to a state of semi lunacy but one or two confessed to their husbands that it required a great admiration of general ople not to despise him both for his susceptibility and his patience",
		"my income",
		"he had for six months at her bidding been actually living the life of a beast degraded in his own esteem scorched by every laugh he heard running pursued overtaken and as it were scored or branded and then let go for the process to be repeated",
		"why then was the terrible test brought to bear upon him of all men",
		"i don t pretend to be and certainly i don t want the young people to think me so",
		"how is it marked in any degree",
		"let me speak",
		"i do not object to her personally",
		"his apology for not appearing at garden parties was that he was engaged to wait on lady camper",
		"prepared",
		"there was that time bye an bye went an ambushed me ah the devil",
		"just then the second mate having managed to slip off the gag shouted warning look out captain",
		"look here stranger he remarked with quiet emphasis we re after that cow lifter an we mean to get him",
		"you ll lose about three days doing it too i can t take no sand range herd over them rocks an i ain t going to drive round no north arm or coyote pass if i could hopalong replied with quiet emphasis",
		"he moved his foot and struck something soft and heavy",
		"and of liquor he had already taken more than his limit",
		"by a sort of mutual unspoken agreement the men in cowan s that night passed up the cards and sat swapping stories",
		"all are welcome he spelled out slowly",
		"if he could have been certain that no danger was nearer to him than these two towns he would have felt vastly relieved even if his horse was not fresh",
		"i m glad all the same that he ain t sober an loose an you ain t going to hit him no more snapped jed white reddening with anger",
		"he awakened from time to time but only for a moment for he was tired and sleepy",
		"well then tom or art does all right no they don t neither i watched em leave an they rode straight out of town an went the other way same as they allus do dave was getting irritated",
		"martin was down the river looking for a man who did not wish to be found and some said that martin cared nothing about international boundaries when he wanted any one real bad",
		"now look at what they went an done he yelled running around in a circle",
		"he allus hangs out there when there are cayuses in town good for him",
		"slight as was the warning it served to ease his fall for instinct freed his feet from the stirrups and when he struck the ground it was feet first and although he fell flat at the next instant the shock had been broken",
		"oh yes but you are",
		"hey",
		"he began to sidle over towards his neighbor his near hand doubled up into a huge knot of protuberant knuckles and white streaked fingers but as he was about to deliver his hint that he was greatly displeased at the antics of the bench a sob came to his ears",
		"is somebody abusing you hopalong bit into a generous handful of dried apricots chewed complacently for a moment and replied at s aw right i want my cayuse swallowing hastily he continued i want it an i ve come to the right place for it too",
		"hastening back to the corral he added a cipher to the posted figure added a decimal point and changed the cents sign to that of a dollar",
		"i am going to do that same thing an prove that you are a pack of fools",
		"elkins had stumbled here but there were no toe marks to tell of it",
		"get up damn you",
		"mr neal was making his arms move and was also shouting something at the top of his voice",
		"he passed",
		"i d be a fine sort of a coyote to sneak off an leave you for them fiends",
		"you bet it s a hummer cried boston reaching for the whiskey bottle under cover of the excitement and enthusiasm",
		"i wouldn t a cared then come on now get up",

		"i ve heard me father tell of the press gangs on the other side an t is small business yensen looked up to reply chanced to glance aft and dropped his calking iron in his astonishment",
		"their shooting an the rain will cover what noise we make on the soft ground",
		"such inconsistency is trying to the temper of the best mannered horse and this particular animal was not in the least good mannered wherefore its rider was obliged to soothe its resentment in his own peculiar way listening meanwhile to the loud and impassioned voice of the evangelist haranguing his small audience",
		"i can drink about a bucketful right now moodily replied his companion",
		"are you hurt very bad no not very bad lied holden trying to smile",
		"so yo re another one of em hey",
		"as they rode down the trail and around a corner he turned in his saddle and looked back and then rode on buried in thought",
		"missed",
		"thirty mile long without a gate so they says but it don t close this trail cried hopalong in blank astonishment",
		"several weeks later buck peters drew rein and waited for a stranger to join him",
		"yes first thing in the morning breakfast ll be ready soon as you are",
		"jack snipe too laughed pete",
		"it does drop when you let go of it he observed",
		"i d hate to see what you ll be seeing before long",
		"i m awful glad i met you holden",
		"he d try to push back a stampede by main strength if he reckoned it was his duty",
		"trot him out ordered red grimly",
		"a man owes something to all his friends hopalong mused",
		"these thoughts kept him company for a day and when he dismounted before stevenson s hotel in hoyt s corners he summed up his feelings for the enlightenment of his horse",
		"more whispering went on under that roof than in all the other places in town put together for here rustling was planned wayfaring strangers were trimmed in frame ups at cards and a hunted man was certain to find assistance",
		"it s longer but there ll be more water that way at this time of the year",
		"evidently mr cassidy s eyes were better and his temper sweeter for he hummed dixie and then jumped to yankee doodle mixing the two airs with careless impartiality which was a sign that he was thinking deeply",
		"have you divine insight",
		"i ain t a going to live nohow so there ain t no use of anybody staying here with me to die with me",

		"the shock was on the way and as events proved was to be one long to linger in the minds of the inhabitants of perry s bend and the surrounding range",
		"johnny groaned and held his stomach but his eyes lighted up when he saw the guns and he eagerly took one of each kind a faint smile wreathing his lips",
		"he fired at the smoke as he dropped and then wriggled rapidly backward keeping as flat to the earth as he could",
		"come back here you chump cried hopalong running forward",
		"one of the citizens dangling his legs from the card table again looked closely at the man with the plan and then turned to a companion beside him",
		"there s something crooked going on in that canyon an i know it",
		"martin weighed one hundred and eighty pounds and packed no fat on his well knit frame",

		"how do i know you ain t now",
		"i ve been told my father was the same way so i must inherit it",
		"god be with you and may you die as he died repentant and in peace buck chafed impatiently before the chapel door leading to a small well kept graveyard wondering what it was that kept quiet for so long a time his two most assertive men when he had momentarily expected to hear more or less turmoil and confusion",

		"the iron heaters tossed a hot iron each to red and johnny and the eight were marked in short order making about two hundred and fifty they had branded in three hours",
		"well i m damned snorted hopalong with cutting contempt",
		"he felt that refreshing coolness which so often precedes a storm and as he weighed it in his mind a low rumble of thunder rolled in the north and sent a chill down his back",
		"i never did much pot shooting cept agin injuns but i dunno he did not finish for the strangers were almost at his elbow",
		"i ve got a long way to go an delay is costly how much did you say these yaller fellers cost he asked significantly trying another handful of apricots",
		"holden steadying himself against the wall leaned in a window on the other side of the shack and emptied his colt in a dazed manner doing his very best",
		"on the way home he cogitated upon it and two points challenged his intelligence with renewed insistence the ghost showed itself only on friday and then only to greasers his suspicious mind would not rest until he had reviewed the question from all sides and his opinion was that there was something more than spiritual about the ghost of the san miguel and a cold practical reason for it",
		"that instinctive feeling which singles out two duellists in a card game was soon experienced by the others who were careful as became good players to avoid being caught between them in consequence when the game broke up elkins had most of hopalong s money",

		"slowly opening his bloodshot eyes he squinted about him sick weak racking with pain where heavy shoes had struck him in the melee his head reverberating with roars which seemed almost to split it open",
		"besides the drive outfit had cooled down rapidly when it found that its herd was in no immediate danger and was not anxious to kill any one unless there was need",
		"the discovery that there was no cover on the north side cheered him greatly and he called to boggs outlining a plan of action",
		"you know johnny was in it all the time replied the foreman smiling",
		"called me a thief he did just now",
		"get it out for me an i ll disturb its peace",
		"rage and ferocity seethed in each savage heart and they determined to get the puncher they had chased and that other whose trail they now saw for the first time",
		"i d be a fine sort of a coyote to leave him in that hell hole an not go back wouldn t i he said with quiet determination",

		"level headed old cuss he s a wonder when it comes to planning or fighting",
		"but the spirits of youth recover quickly his recovered so quickly that he was banished from the herd the very next night which banishment not being at all to his liking was enforced only by rigid watchfulness and hard riding and he was roundly cursed from dark to dawn by the worried men most of whom disliked the bumming youngster less than they pretended",
		"anything is easy when you know how",
		"burning hair is bad for throat and temper alike",
		"the liquor he had once been in the habit of consuming had been reduced to a negligible quantity he spent the money on cartridges instead and his pistol work showed the results of careful and dogged practice particularly in the quickness of the draw",

		"an i m going home an i m going to stay there",
		"there would be no strategy johnny wounded and desperate was fighting for his life",
		"with the exception of a bench a table and a small altar the room was devoid of furnishings and the effect of these was lost in the dim light from the narrow windows",

		"augurs",
		"he sat quietly for a time after the gaudy missile had disappeared into the stream and then wheeling cantered away",

		"that s flat he began to talk feverishly to gain time and his eyes lighted suddenly",
		"our broncs are gone yelled stevenson shoving old john roughly to one side as he dashed through the doorway and on into the room he had assigned to the sullen and bibulous stranger",
		"while he weighed it his incredulity holding back the decision his common sense was striving to give him the noise grew louder rapidly and common sense won out in a cry of warning an instant before a five foot wall of brown water burst upon his sight sweeping swiftly down the old dry river bed and behind it towered another and greater wall",
		"so long he turned to red and shook hands silently led his horse out of the building and mounted glad that the moon had not yet come up for in the darkness he had a chance",

		"lighting it he looked up again and saw that the horseman was wildly waving a sombrero",
		"the time might come when the barbarous and barbarizing power which we by our moral support had helped into existence would require a general crusade of civilized europe to extinguish the mischief which it had allowed and we had aided to rise up in the midst of our civilization",
		"the moment a president was elected of whom it was inferred from his opinions not that he would take any measures against slavery where it exists but that he would oppose its establishment where it exists not that moment they broke loose from what was at least a very solemn contract and formed themselves into a confederation professing as its fundamental principle not merely the perpetuation but the indefinite extension of slavery",
		"but this institution is the only one of them all which requires to keep it going that human beings should be burnt alive",
		"let us suppose the worst possible issue of this war the one apparently desired by those english writers whose moral feeling is so philosophically indifferent between the apostles of slavery and its enemies",
		"the act itself may have been imposed by the necessity of the circumstances but the reasons given the principles of action professed were their own choice",
		"let us then without reference to these jars or to the declamations of newspaper writers on either side of the atlantic examine the american question as it stood from the beginning its origin the purpose of both the combatants and its various possible or probable issues",
		"but to those who say that because this may have to be done at last it ought to have been done at first i put the very serious question on what terms",
		"the only thing which no one seemed to expect is what has actually happened",
		"they have disclaimed all right to attempt anything which that constitution forbids",
		"could the union abandon them without even an effort to be dealt with at the pleasure of an exasperated slave owning oligarchy",
		"the calm and dispassionate mr olmsted affirms that there has not been a single year for many years past in which this horror is not known to have been perpetrated in some part or other of the south",
		"now when the mind of england and it may almost be said of the civilized part of mankind has been relieved from the incubus which had weighed on it ever since the trent outrage and when we are no longer feeling towards the northern americans as men feel towards those with whom they may be on the point of struggling for life or death now if ever is the time to review our position and consider whether we have been feeling what ought to have been felt and wishing what ought to have been wished regarding the contest in which the northern states are engaged with the south",
		"is there any one capable of a moral judgment or feeling who will say that his opinion of america and american statesmen is not raised by such an act done on such grounds",
		"these have been such as most of us i venture to say did not by any means expect",
		"were the right of the slave owners to secede ever so clear they have no right to carry these with them unless allegiance is a mere question of local proximity and my next neighbor if i am a stronger man can be compelled to follow me in any lawless vagaries i choose to indulge",
		"compared with that the one in force at the time of the secession was a free trade tariff this latter was the result of several successive modifications in the direction of freedom and its principle was not protection for protection but as much of it only as might incidentally result from duties imposed for revenue",
		"i do not forget one regrettable passage in mr seward s letter in which he said that if the safety of the union required the detention of the captured persons it would be the right and duty of this government to detain them",
		"putting the worst hypothesis possible which it would be the height of injustice to entertain seriously that the concession was really made solely to convenience and that the profession of regard for justice was hypocrisy even so the ground taken even if insincerely is the most hopeful sign of the moral state of the american mind which has appeared for many years",
		"the only real difference is that the present rebels are more powerful than cartouche or turpin and may possibly be able to effect their iniquitous purpose",
		"unless we abandon the principles we have for two generations consistently professed and acted on we should be at war with the new confederacy within five years about the african slave trade",
		"they make no concealment of their principles",
		"that a sense of justice should be the motive which the rulers of a country rely on to reconcile the public to an unpopular and what might seem a humiliating act that the journalists the orators many lawyers the lower house of congress and mr lincoln s own naval secretary should be told in the face of the world by their own government that they have been giving public thanks presents of swords freedom of cities all manner of heroic honors to the author of an act which though not so intended was lawless and wrong and for which the proper remedy is confession and atonement that this should be the accepted policy supposing it to be nothing higher of a democratic republic shows even unlimited democracy to be a better thing than many englishmen have lately been in the habit of considering it and goes some way towards proving that the aberrations even of a ruling multitude are only fatal when the better instructed have not the virtue or the courage to front them boldly",
		"but though not an abolitionist party they are a free soil party",
		"yet the tariff of that day was rigidly protective",
		"the president in his message has already proposed that this salutary reform should be effected in the case of maryland additional territory detached from virginia being given to that state as an equivalent thus clearly indicating the policy which he approves and which he is probably willing to make universal",
		"not by anything said or done by us as a government or as a nation but by the tone of our press and in some degree it must be owned the general opinion of english society",
		"a war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good and which is their own war carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice is often the means of their regeneration",
		"at present all the nations of europe have sympathized with us have acknowledged that we were injured and declared with rare unanimity that we had no choice but to resist if necessary by arms",
		"we expected anything in short which would have been weak and timid and paltry",
		"if this be the true state of the case what are the southern chiefs fighting about",
		"whether or not the northern americans will succeed in reconquering the south i do not affect to foresee",
		"secession may be laudable and so may any other kind of insurrection but it may also be an enormous crime",
		"their apologists in england say that it is about tariffs and similar trumpery",
		"could it abandon the germans who in western texas have made so meritorious a commencement of growing cotton on the borders of the mexican gulf by free labor",
		"suppose however for the sake of argument that the mere will to separate were in this case or in any case a sufficient ground for separation i beg to be informed whose will",
		"they say nothing of the kind",
		"i am far from saying that the present struggle on the part of the northern americans is wholly of this exalted character that it has arrived at the stage of being altogether a war for justice a war of principle",
		"the preservation of the union is an object about which the north are agreed and it has many adherents as they believe in the south generally",
		"but the case can dispense with any mere argumentum ad hominem",
		"i cannot wish that this war should not have been engaged in by the north or that being engaged in it should be terminated on any conditions but such as would retain the whole of the territories as free soil",
		"there is a theory in england believed perhaps by some half believed by many more which is only consistent with original ignorance or complete subsequent forgetfulness of all the antecedents of the contest",
		"separation with them means at least half the territories including the mexican border and the consequent power of invading and overrunning spanish america for the purpose of planting there the peculiar institution which even mexican civilization has found too bad to be endured",
		"further as was pointed out in an admirable letter by mr carey the slave states are intersected in the middle from their northern frontier almost to the gulf of mexico by a country of free labor the mountain region of the alleghanies and their dependencies forming parts of virginia north carolina tennessee georgia and alabama in which from the nature of the climate and of the agricultural and mining industry slavery to any material extent never did and never will exist",
		"or even if unforgotten who would then have felt that such a grievance was a sufficient palliation of the crime",
		"the republican party have taken their stand on law and the existing constitution of the union",
		"but why discuss on probable evidence notorious facts",
		"the doctrine in itself is no other than that professed and acted on by all governments that self preservation in a state as in an individual is a warrant for many things which at all other times ought to be rigidly abstained from",
		"the present government of the united states is not an abolitionist government",
		"without insisting on these things i contend that all previous cause of offence should be considered as cancelled by the reparation which the american government has so amply made not so much the reparation itself which might have been so made as to leave still greater cause of permanent resentment behind it but the manner and spirit in which they have made it",
		"but it is said the north will never succeed in conquering the south and since the separation must in the end be recognized it is better to do at first what must be done at last moreover if it did conquer them it could not govern them when conquered consistently with free institutions",
		"there are heaven knows vicious and tyrannical institutions in ample abundance on the earth",
		"we had suffered an indignity and something more than an indignity which not to have resented would have been to invite a constant succession of insults and injuries from the same and from every other quarter",
		"it will require a succession of humiliation to bring them to that",
		"to allow the slave ships of a confederation formed for the extension of slavery to come and go free and unexamined between america and the african coast would be to renounce even the pretence of attempting to protect africa against the man stealer and abandon that continent to the horrors on a far larger scale which were practised before granville sharp and clarkson were in existence",
		"it would also be right to abrogate that bad provision of the constitution a necessary compromise at the time of its first establishment whereby the slaves though reckoned as citizens in no other respect are counted to the extent of three fifths of their number in the estimate of the population for fixing the number of representatives of each state in the lower house of congress",
		"remember we consider them to be human beings entitled to human rights",
		"this mountain zone is peopled by ardent friends of the union",
		"could it have been expected or even perhaps desired that they should",
		"but there was from the beginning and now is a large infusion of that element in it and this is increasing will increase and if the war lasts will in the end predominate",
		"when the new confederate states made an independent power by english help had begun their crusade to carry negro slavery from the potomac to cape horn who would then have remembered that england raised up this scourge to humanity not for the evil s sake but because somebody had offered an insult to her flag",
		"their right to separate is the right which cartouche or turpin would have had to secede from their respective countries because the laws of those countries would not suffer them to rob and murder on the highway",
		"neither did the constitution in their own opinion require them to permit the introduction of slavery into the territories which were not yet states",
		"for these reasons i cannot join with those who cry peace peace",
		"we had indeed been wronged",
		"it is too true that the feelings which have been manifested since the beginning of the american contest the judgments which have been put forth and the wishes which have been expressed concerning the incidents and probable eventualities of the struggle the bitter and irritating criticism which has been kept up not even against both parties equally but almost solely against the party in the right and the ungenerous refusal of all those just allowances which no country needs more than our own whenever its circumstances are as near to those of america as a cut finger is to an almost mortal wound these facts with minds not favorably disposed to us would have gone far to make the most odious interpretation of the war in which we have been so nearly engaged with the united states appear by many degrees the most probable",
		"middle parties and friends of compromise are soon left behind and if the writers who so severely criticize the present moderation of the free soilers are desirous to see the war become an abolition war it is probable that if the war lasts long enough they will be gratified",
		"if this knowledge does not come to them for several years the abolition question will by that time have settled itself",
		"to prevent this the republican party was formed and to prevent it they are now fighting as the slave owners are fighting to enforce it",
		"we the emancipators of the slave who have wearied every court and government in europe and america with our protests and remonstrances until we goaded them into at least ostensibly coöperating with us to prevent the enslaving of the negro we who for the last half century have spent annual sums equal to the revenue of a small kingdom in blockading the african coast for a cause in which we not only had no interest but which was contrary to our pecuniary interest and which many believed would ruin as many among us still though erroneously believe that it has ruined our colonies we should have lent a hand to setting up in one of the most commanding positions of the world a powerful republic devoted not only to slavery but to pro slavery propagandism should have helped to give a place in the community of nations to a conspiracy of slave owners who have broken their connection with the american federation on the sole ground ostentatiously proclaimed that they thought an attempt would be made to restrain not slavery itself but their purpose of spreading slavery wherever migration or force could carry it",
		"one fact is enough",
		"the republicans well know that if they can reëstablish the union they gain everything for which they originally contended and it would be a plain breach of faith with the southern friends of the government if after rallying them round its standard for a purpose of which they approve it were suddenly to alter its terms of communion without their consent",
		"are we to see with indifference its victorious army let loose to propagate their national faith at the rifle s mouth through mexico and central america",
		"every reader of a newspaper to the farthest ends of the earth would have believed and remembered one thing only that at the critical juncture which was to decide whether slavery should blaze up afresh with increased vigor or be trodden out at the moment of conflict between the good and the evil spirit at the dawn of a hope that the demon might now at last be chained and flung into the pit england stepped in and for the sake of cotton made satan victorious",
		"war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war is worse",
		"it is wonderful how easy and liberal and complying people can be in other people s concerns",
		"without the smallest pretension to see further into futurity than other people i at least have foreseen and foretold from the first that if the south were not promptly put down the contest would become distinctly an antislavery one nor do i believe that any person accustomed to reflect on the course of human affairs in troubled times can expect anything else",
		"if reparation were made at all of which few of us felt more than a hope we thought that it would have been made obviously as a concession to prudence not to principle",
		"they talk but little in the existing emergency even of the original cause of quarrel",
		"the south are in rebellion not for simple slavery they are in rebellion for the right of burning human creatures alive",
		"but to be able to defy calumny a nation like an individual must stand very clear of just reproach in its previous conduct",
		"two or three defeats in the field breaking their military strength though not followed by an invasion of their territory may possibly teach it to them",
		"this is carrying the doctrine of the sacred right of insurrection rather far",
		"though the thing was pre determined and most of the states committed by their public authorities before the people were called on to vote though in taking the votes terrorism in many places reigned triumphant yet even so in several of the states secession was carried only by narrow majorities",
		"a great party does not change suddenly and at once all its principles and professions",
		"to slavery therefore it is a matter of life and death to find fresh fields for the employment of slave labor",
		"an article would have to be inserted prohibiting the extension of slavery to the territories or the admission into the union of any new slave state",
		"slavery under the conditions in which it exists in the states exhausts even the beneficent powers of nature",
		"it is true enough that the north are not carrying on war to abolish slavery in the states where it legally exists",
		"the most ordinary policy teaches them to inscribe on their banner that part only of their known principles in which their supporters are unanimous",
		"i am not blind to the possibility that it may require a long war to lower the arrogance and tame the aggressive ambition of the slave owners to the point of either returning to the union or consenting to remain out of it with their present limits",
		"what by a rhetorical license the worst oppressors of the human race by way of stamping on them the most hateful character possible are said to be these men in very truth are",
		"as long as they were allowed to direct all the policy of the union to break through compromise after compromise encroach step after step until they reached the pitch of claiming a right to carry slave property into the free states and in opposition to the laws of those states hold it as property there so long they were willing to remain in the union",
		"after our people by their cold disapprobation and our press by its invective had combined with their own difficulties to damp the spirit of the free states and drive them to submit and make peace we should have to fight the slave states ourselves at far greater disadvantages when we should no longer have the wearied and exhausted north for an ally",
		"in one of his recent letters he names the end of next summer as the period by which if the war has not sooner terminated it will have assumed a complete anti slavery character",
		"let me in a few words remind the reader what sort of a thing this is which the white oligarchy of the south have banded themselves together to propagate and establish if they could universally",
		"the necessity of reconciling themselves to the confinement of slavery within its existing boundaries with the natural consequence immediate mitigation of slavery and ultimate emancipation is a lesson which they are in no mood to learn from anything but disaster",
		"we expected that the atonement if atonement there were would have been made with reservations perhaps under protest",
		"their leaders never say one word implying disapprobation of it",
		"if brought back by force and not by voluntary compact they will return without the territories and without a fugitive slave law",
		"there is no denying that our attitude towards the contending parties i mean our moral attitude for politically there was no other course open to us than neutrality has not been that which becomes a people who are as sincere enemies of slavery as the english really are and have made as great sacrifices to put an end to it where they could",
		"it will be desirable to take thought beforehand what are to be our own future relations with a new power professing the principles of attila and genghis khan as the foundation of its constitution",
		"to have accepted it under that limitation would have been on the part of the south to give up that which they have seceded expressly to preserve",
		"but the consequences of such a war would soon have buried its causes in oblivion",
		"there are people who tell us that on the side of the north the question is not one of slavery at all",
		"a man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself",
		"and no one can suppose that the south would have consented or in their present temper ever will consent to an accommodation on any other terms",
		"when it is wished to describe any portion of the human race as in the lowest state of debasement and under the most cruel oppression in which it is possible for human beings to live they are compared to slaves",
		"when we are in the act of sending an expedition against mexico to redress the wrongs of private british subjects we should do well to reflect in time that the president of the new republic mr jefferson davis was the original inventor of repudiation",
		"it seems to me a strange doctrine that the most serious and responsible of all human acts imposes no obligation on those who do it of showing that they have a real grievance that those who rebel for the power of oppressing others exercise as sacred a right as those who do the same thing to resist oppression practised upon themselves",
		"the cotton cultivation in the opinion of all competent judges alone saves north american slavery but cotton cultivation exclusively adhered to exhausts in a moderate number of years all the soils which are fit for it and can only be kept up by travelling farther and farther westward",
		"with no one of these propositions can i agree",
		"and not upon negroes only the edinburgh review in a recent number gave the hideous details of the burning alive of an unfortunate northern huckster by lynch law on mere suspicion of having aided in the escape of a slave",
		"i do not mean that all of them are hateful personally any more than all the inquisitors or all the buccaneers",
		"and when we consider the flood of wrath which would have been poured out against them if they did by the very writers who now taunt them with not doing it we shall be apt to think the taunt a little misplaced",
		"what must american slavery be if deeds like these are necessary under it and if they are not necessary and are yet done is not the evidence against slavery still more damning",
		"nor ought it to be forgotten to the honor of mr lincoln s government that in doing what was in itself right they have done also what was best fitted to allay the animosity which was daily becoming more bitter between the two nations so long as the question remained open",
		"should that time come not only will the greatest enormity which still exists among mankind as an institution receive far earlier its coups de grâce than there has ever until now appeared any probability of but in effecting this the free states will have raised themselves to that elevated position in the scale of morality and dignity which is derived from great sacrifices consciously made in a virtuous cause and the sense of an inestimable benefit to all future ages brought about by their own voluntary efforts",
		"they know as all know who have attended to the subject that confinement within existing limits is its death warrant",
		"they are ready on the contrary to give it new guarantees to renounce all that they have been contending for to win back if opportunity offers the south to the union by surrendering the whole point",
		"because they are willing to surrender their own past and have no objection to join in reprobation of their great grandfathers they never put themselves the question what they themselves would do in circumstances far less trying under far less pressure of real national calamity",
		"but even of the white population it is questionable if there was in the beginning a majority for secession anywhere but in south carolina",
		"when words are sought by which to stigmatize the most odious despotism exercised in the most odious manner and all other comparisons are found inadequate the despots are said to be like slave masters or slave drivers",
		"and they know as we may know if we please that this amounts to the same thing",
		"however natural in the country itself it is rather cool in english writers who talk so glibly of the ten millions i believe there are only eight to pass over the very existence of four millions who must abhor the idea of separation",
		"mr lincoln s government have done none of these things",
		"the cloud which for the space of a month hung gloomily over the civilized world black with far worse evils than those of simple war has passed from over our heads without bursting",
		"unfortunately we ourselves have given too much plausibility to the charge",
		"it does forbid interference by the federal congress with slavery in the slave states but it does not forbid their abolishing it in the district of columbia and this they are now doing having voted i perceive in their present pecuniary straits a million of dollars to indemnify the slave owners of the district",
		"for assuredly congress will very soon make up its mind to declare all slaves free who belong to persons in arms against the union",
		"mississippi was the first state which repudiated mr jefferson davis was governor of mississippi and the legislature of mississippi had passed a bill recognizing and providing for the debt which bill mr jefferson davis vetoed",
		"and it has been an additional misfortune that some of our most powerful journals have been for many years past very unfavorable exponents of english feeling on all subjects connected with slavery some probably from the influences more or less direct of west indian opinions and interests others from inbred toryism which even when compelled by reason to hold opinions favorable to liberty is always adverse to it in feeling which likes the spectacle of irresponsible power exercised by one person over others which has no moral repugnance to the thought of human beings born to the penal servitude for life to which for the term of a few years we sentence our most hardened criminals but keeps its indignation to be expended on rabid and fanatical abolitionists across the atlantic and on those writers in england who attach a sufficiently serious meaning to their christian professions to consider a fight against slavery as a fight for god",
		"the day when slavery can no longer extend itself is the day of its doom",
		"abolitionists in america mean those who do not keep within the constitution who demand the destruction as far as slavery is concerned of as much of it as protects the internal legislation of each state from the control of congress who aim at abolishing slavery wherever it exists by force if need be but certainly by some other power than the constituted authorities of the slave states",
		"when men set themselves up in defiance of the rest of the world to do the devil s work no good can come of them until the world has made them feel that this work cannot be suffered to be done any longer",
		"it is almost superfluous to remark that a democratic government always shows worst where other governments generally show best on its outside that unreasonable people are much more noisy than the reasonable that the froth and scum are the part of a violently fermenting liquid that meets the eyes but are not its body and substance",
		"but i certainly never conceived that there was a sufficient title to my sympathy in the mere fact of being a rebel that the act of taking arms against one s fellow citizens was so meritorious in itself was so completely its own justification that no question need be asked concerning the motive",
		"so incompatible is it with any kind whatever of skilled labor that it causes the whole productive resources of the country to be concentrated on one or two products cotton being the chief which require to raise and prepare them for the market little besides brute animal force",
		"the north it seems have no more objection to slavery than the south have",
		"they tell the world and they told their own citizens when they wanted their votes that the object of the fight was slavery",
		"whether they will persevere to this point or whether their spirit their patience and the sacrifices they are willing to make will be exhausted before reaching it i cannot tell",
		"not by taking military possession of their country or marching an army through it but by wearing them out exhausting their resources depriving them of the comforts of life encouraging their slaves to desert and excluding them from communication with foreign countries",
		"the world knows what the question between the north and south has been for many years and still is",
		"the fear has not been realized that the only two first rate powers who are also free nations would take to tearing each other in pieces both the one and the other in a bad and odious cause",
		"we expected that the correspondence would have been spun out and a trial made to induce england to be satisfied with less or that there would have been a proposal of arbitration or that england would have been asked to make concessions in return for justice or that if submission was made it would have been made ostensibly to the opinions and wishes of continental europe",
		"but war in a good cause is not the greatest evil which a nation can suffer",
		"their pride and self conceit swelled to an inordinate height by their successful struggle would defy the power of england as they had already successfully defied that of their northern countrymen",
		"but the parties in a protracted civil war almost invariably end by taking more extreme not to say higher grounds of principle than they began with",
		"have they ever considered what would have been the meaning of separation if it had been assented to by the northern states when first demanded",
		"and first it is necessary to ask have the slaves been consulted",
		"suppose that the north should stoop to recognize the new confederation on its own terms leaving it half the territories and that it is acknowledged by europe and takes its place as an admitted member of the community of nations",
		"before admitting the authority of any persons as organs of the will of the people to dispose of the whole political existence of a country i ask to see whether their credentials are from the whole or only from a part",
		"nor can it be doubted that the mere fact of belonging to a union in some parts of which slavery is reprobated is some alleviation of their condition if only as regards future probabilities",
		"the slave owners know this and it is the cause of their fury",
		"but the position which they occupy and the abstract excellence of which they are in arms to vindicate is that which the united voice of mankind habitually selects as the type of all hateful qualities",
		"people talk as if separation meant nothing more than the independence of the seceding states",
		"we could have acted no otherwise than we have done yet it is impossible to think without something like a shudder from what we have escaped",
		"in some the authorities have not dared to publish the numbers in some it is asserted that no vote has ever been taken",
		"but even if the right of intercepting their slavers were acknowledged by treaty which it never would be the arrogance of the southern slave holders would not long submit to its exercise",
		"they may in the end be wearied into recognizing the separation",
		"an english government will hardly be base enough to recognize them unless they accept all the treaties by which america is at present bound nor it may be hoped even if de facto independent would they be admitted to the courtesies of diplomatic intercourse unless they granted in the most explicit manner the right of search",
		"it was not very poetic bliss perhaps but nevertheless it is a fact that the cleanness of the sea and the sea air was as attractive to us as any of the sea attributes",
		"our civilisation seemed nothing but a thin film or crust lying over a volcanic pit and i often wondered whether some day the pit would not break up through it and destroy us all",
		"when the anguish begotten by some outbreak on the part of the wife more violent than usual became almost too much to bear we did our best to counsel and as a last consolation we could point to death divine death and repose",

		"finally said the speaker i am sure we all of us will pass a vote of thanks to our reverend friend for coming to see us and we cordially invite him to come again",

		"we had no need of other explanation those tears spoke at once my confession and my repentance",
		"i knew him but slightly said falkland and then added with a sneer the only times i ever met him were at your house",
		"replied falkland but i would give worlds for such a proof that death does not destroy",
		"when you are beside me your hand if it trembles is not on fire your voice if it is more subdued does not falter with the emotions it dares not express your heart is not like mine devoured by a parching and wasting flame your sleep is not turned by restless and turbulent dreams from the healthful renewal into the very consumer of life",

		"the same stars that for thousands of unfathomed years had looked upon the changes of this nether world gleamed pale and pure and steadfast upon their burning but transitory vow",
		"and wilt thou leave that happy home where once it was so sweet to live",
		"the dead answered me not when i invoked them and in the vigils of the still night i looked from the rank grass and the mouldering stones to the eternal heavens as man looks from decay to immortality",

		"i did not confine myself to books all things breathing or inanimate constituted my study",
		"we can mock at the fury of the elements for they are less terrible than the passions of the heart at the devastations of the awful skies for they are less desolating than the wrath of man at the convulsions of that surrounding nature which has no peril no terror to the soul which is more indestructible and eternal than itself",
		"wait not the hour when all the mind shall to the crowd be given for links which to the million bind shall from the one be riven",
		"the various streams with which the country abounded were swelled by late rains into an unwonted rapidity and breadth and their voices blended with the rushing sound of the winds and the distant roll of the thunder which began at last sullenly to subside",

		"he had none of the vanity most men have in conquest he would not have had any human being know that he was loved",
		"if you loved like me you would feel that it was something of pride of triumph to dare all things even crime for the one to whom all things are as nought",
		"they stood beneath the calm and holy skies a guilty and devoted pair a fearful contrast of the sin and turbulence of this unquiet earth to the passionless serenity of the eternal heaven",

		"and lady margaret turned utterly unconscious of the reproach she had conveyed towards emily",
		"the deep light of the summer moon shone over falkland s countenance which emily gazed on as she listened almost tremblingly to his words",

		"je ne me trompe pas dit il en l abordant avec son plus aimable sourire c est bien vous monsieur qui m avez si complaisamment servi de guide à suez",
		"il y eut encore quelques éclats de cris lointains et enfin à tout ce tumulte succéda un profond silence",
		"la nuit s écoula ainsi",
		"le conducteur se battait aux côtés de mr fogg quand une balle le renversa",
		"ni les bassins ni les docks de londres n avaient jamais reçu un navire ayant pour armateur phileas fogg",
		"mais l elder sans s inquiéter de cette désertion raconta avec détail comme quoi joe smyth fit banqueroute en comme quoi ses actionnaires ruinés l enduisirent de goudron et le roulèrent dans la plume comme quoi on le retrouva plus honorable et plus honoré que jamais quelques années après à independance dans le missouri et chef d une communauté florissante qui ne comptait pas moins de trois mille disciples et qu alors poursuivi par la haine des gentils il dut fuir dans le far west américain",

		"mais comment ne vous ai je pas aperçu à bord depuis notre départ de calcutta",
		"le purser l homme de confiance de la compagnie l égal du capitaine à bord faisait somptueusement les choses",
		"phileas fogg la jeune femme fix et passepartout confortablement assis regardaient le paysage varié qui passait sous leurs yeux vastes prairies montagnes se profilant à l horizon creeks roulant leurs eaux écumeuses",
		"il était donc fondé à se demander si un coeur humain battait sous cette froide enveloppe si phileas fogg avait une âme sensible aux beautés de la nature aux aspirations morales",

		"phileas fogg",
		"reprit phileas fogg sans que sa voix trahît la moindre émotion ces barbares coutumes subsistent encore dans l inde et les anglais n ont pu les détruire",

		"merci capitaine",
		"ce wagon long d une cinquantaine de pieds se prêtait très convenablement à la circonstance",

		"oui",
		"il se tint au grand frais mais malheureusement il souffla avec obstination de la partie du sud est et ne permit pas de faire de la toile",
		"le lendemain du départ de suez le octobre ce ne fut pas sans un certain plaisir qu il rencontra sur le pont l obligeant personnage auquel il s était adressé en débarquant en égypte",

		"je ne donnerais pas ma part de quatre mille livres dans le pari dit andrew stuart en s asseyant quand même on m en offrirait trois mille neuf cent quatre vingt dix neuf",

		"il s agit d une promenade en mer",
		"il y a autre chose",
		"telles furent les premières paroles qu il prononça au milieu des suffocations de la colère et certes pour peu que le digne homme eût été apoplectique il n en serait jamais revenu",
		"cela me convient parfaitement répondit phileas fogg",
		"mr fogg était impassible et cependant sa fortune entière se jouait à ce moment a ce moment aussi un long fuseau noir couronné d un panache de fumée apparut au ras de l eau",
		"sir francis cromarty prit place dans l un des cacolets phileas fogg dans l autre",

		"tout ému il se demanda où et quand il pourrait bien se dévouer pour lui",
		"cela lui paraissait invraisemblable",
		"fix lui ne voyait pas ces choses du même oeil",
		"d abord il faisait ses quatre repas par jour sans que jamais ni roulis ni tangage pussent détraquer une machine si merveilleusement organisée",

		"ayez de bonnes chaussures",
		"le nom de son maître n y figurait pas",
		"ce repas s accomplit dans les mêmes conditions que le déjeuner avec adjonction de royal british sauce",
		"les cartes nous trouverons bien à les acheter",
		"murmurait passepartout brûlée vive",
		"on vivait donc bien à bord du mongolia dans cette société de fonctionnaires auxquels se mêlaient quelques jeunes anglais qui le million en poche allaient fonder au loin des comptoirs de commerce",
		"depuis son jeune âge il habitait l inde et n avait fait que de rares apparitions dans son pays natal",
		"un citoyen anglais répondit phileas fogg",
		"c était probable car personne ne possédait mieux que lui la carte du monde",

		"ils étaient de la plus forte taille leur corps dépassait trois pieds en longueur et le dessous de leurs ailes blanches resplendissait au soleil on eut dit des requins ailés avec lesquels ils avaient une formidable ressemblance",
		"et du café à discrétion ajouta le docteur",

		"dick et joe s étendirent sur leur couche paisible et s endormirent d un profond sommeil pendant le quart du docteur à minuit celui ci fut remplacé par l écossais",
		"fit joe vous pensez mon maître que l équateur passe par ici",
		"kennedy regardait et n avait pas assez d yeux pour tout voir",
		"bientôt les crêtes d une montagne prirent une taille plus arrêtée",
		"je traverserai le fleuve avec de l air chaud",
		"maintenant dit fergusson prends deux fusils ami dick l un pour toi l autre pour joe et tâchez à vous deux de rapporter quelques belles tranches d antilope",
		"non pas",
		"depuis le moment de leur départ les voyageurs marchèrent avec une grande rapidité il leur tardait de quitter ce désert qui avait failli leur être si funeste",
		"le ciel t entende",
		"cette disposition présentait cet avantage que s il fallait donner issue au gaz pour descendre on laisserait échapper d abord celui du grand ballon dût on même le vider entièrement le petit resterait intact on pouvait alors se débarrasser de l enveloppe extérieure comme d un poids incommode et le second aérostat demeuré seul n offrait pas au vent la prise que donnent les ballons à demi dégonflés",
		"fit kennedy en levant les épaules",
		"cela fait plaisir de voir notre brave victoria",
		"le simoun arrivait en effet avec la rapidité de la foudre",
		"un vilain pays dit joe et il me semble que monsieur kennedy ne se porte pas bien pour y avoir passé la nuit",
		"le nouveau victoria cubait soixante sept mille pieds et renfermait trente",
		"mon maître",
		"c est cette différence entre le poids du gaz contenu dans le ballon et le poids de l air environnant qui constitue la force ascensionnelle de l aérostat",
		"a nos coups de fusil il aura reconnu un secours inespéré une intervention providentielle",
		"l aspect de cette partie de l afrique était inquiétant d ailleurs",
		"rien n est plus facile dick nous sommes droit au dessus de la ville permets moi de tourner un peu le robinet du chalumeau et nous ne tarderons pas à descendre",
		"il n y avait pas une objection à lui faire tout était prévu et résolu",
		"burton et speke n eurent qu à se louer de l hospitalité des habitants de la ville",
		"chapitre xiii changement de temps fièvre de kennedy la médecine du docteur voyage par terre le bassin d imengé le mont rubeho a six mille pieds joe une halte de jour",
		"richardson barth et overweg jaloux de pousser plus loin leurs investigations arrivent à tunis et à tripoli comme leurs devanciers et parviennent à mourzouk capitale du fezzan",
		"je les vois répliqua kennedy ils sont au moins une douzaine quatorze si vous voulez bien répondit joe",
		"fit kennedy je serais assez curieux de le connaître",
		"personne ne se fit prier",
		"le sénégal",
		"et tu descendras à volonté je descendrai à volonté",
		"et maintenant joe dit le docteur jette moi en dehors une cinquantaine de livres de ton minerai",
		"encore un nuage",
		"ces jeunes gens se passionnaient pour les découvertes faites depuis quarante ans en afrique il leur raconta les explorations de barth de burton de speke de grant il leur dépeignit cette mystérieuse contrée livrée de toutes part aux investigations de la science",
		"fit joe",
		"ainsi ces deux frères échappèrent au sort commun",
		"avait dit joe",
		"mais s ils le tuent cette nuit",
		"en effet les hautes cimes arrivaient sur les voyageurs à faire croire qu elles se précipitaient sur eux ils étaient loin de les dominer il s en fallait de plus de cinq cents pieds encore",
		"impossible de se faire entendre",
		"dans l après midi le ciel se couvrit d un brouillard chaud qui suintait du sol l embrun permettait à peine de distinguer les objets terrestres aussi craignant de se heurter contre quelque pic imprévu le docteur donna vers cinq heures le signal d arrêt",
		"le docteur pansa ses blessures et le coucha sous la tente",
		"le victoria fit un bond de trois cents pieds dans l air et prit directement la route du nord",
		"il se fit une trouée dans les nuages la terre reparut le victoria s en approchait insensiblement",
		"il est impossible",
		"dans le nord le jeune duveyrier explorait le sahara et ramenait à paris les chefs touaregs",
		"et pendant ce temps répartit le docteur je prendrai mes mesures de manière à pouvoir nous enlever rapidement",
		"mais dans notre situation il ne faut rien négliger nous allons monter",
		"que jeter",
		"un de ces maudits noirs s est accroché au dessous de la nacelle",
		"jette les deux fusils",
		"bon",
		"il paraît que les voyageurs du second aérostat avaient eu au même moment la même pensée car le même drapeau répétait identiquement le même salut dans une main qui l agitait de la même façon",
		"c est le nil",
		"son premier soin fut de montrer à fergusson une forte contusion qu il se fit à la tête",
		"fais à ta guise",
		"bien fit le docteur",
		"diable",
		"hommes femmes enfants esclaves marchands arabes et nègres tout disparut et se glissa dans les tembés et sous les huttes",
		"attention dit kennedy feu",
		"s écria kennedy à son tour ceci n est pas croyable",
		"et toi joe",
		"ah",
		"ces mille réflexions se heurtaient dans sa tête qu il prenait dans ses mains et pendant des heures entières il ne la relevait pas",
		"joe ne répondit rien et s étendit moelleusement sur son lit de minerai",
		"non mais si son ancre venait à se détacher",
		"une crainte superstitieuse retenait encore la foule et l empêchait de se porter à des violences contre sa personne il gravit rapidement les échelons et joe le suivit avec agilité",
		"mais en tout cas notre victoria ne serait pas embarrassé de les franchir",
		"tout ce qu il pensait était juste tout ce qu il disait sensé tout ce qu il commandait faisable tout ce qu il entreprenait possible tout ce qu il achevait admirable",
		"mais la morale de ceci c est que les honneurs sont éphémères et il ne faut pas trop y prendre goût",
		"le vent un beau jour y a jeté une graine de palmier et le palmier a poussé comme en plein champ",
		"nous couperons la corde",
		"le gaz brûlerait tranquillement et nous descendrions peu à peu",
		"il y a quelque chose",
		"les ancres les cordes les instruments les couvertures de voyage la tente les vivres les armes durent prendre dans la nacelle la place qui leur était assignée la provision d eau fut faite à zanzibar",
		"mais l espoir poussait samuel en avant",
		"un moment même il crut distinctement en saisir une à deux cents pas de distance mais ce ne fut qu un éclair après lequel il ne vit plus rien",
		"trois mille quatre cent quatre vingts pieds cubes de gaz l appareil de dilatation paraissait être en bon état ni la pile ni le serpentin n avaient été endommagés",
		"l eau",
		"répétait joe qui ne pouvait se rendre et multipliait ses expériences à tour de bras",
		"l on peut appeler justement cette immense contrée le cimetière des européens",
		"laissons les faire",
		"suis maintenant ce parallèle et arrive à kazeh",
		"nous ne sommes pas à quatre vingt dix milles de gondokoro dit le docteur en pointant sa tête et à moins de cinq milles du point atteint par les explorateurs venus du nord",
		"il n y avait pas besoin de le nommer",
		"si je ne me trompe dit kennedy voici à l horizon les montagnes dont tu parlais samuel",
		"joe signala vers le soir une lueur immense dans l ouest",
		"rapprochons nous de terre avec précaution",
		"bah",
		"les habitants travaillaient à la récolte du coton devant des cabanes de roseaux tressés au milieu d enclos propres et soigneusement entretenus",
		"dit il nous ne pouvons descendre",
		"ce savant lui proposa même un jour de résoudre le problème suivant dans le but de lui être agréable étant donné le nombre de milles parcourus par le docteur autour du monde combien sa tête en a t elle fait de plus que ses pieds par suite de la différence des rayons",
		"cela se fera cependant",
		"voici l afrique telle que tu te la représentais joe j avais raison de te dire prends patience",
		"j en mourrais de honte",
		"kennedy accoudé sur la nacelle de manière à surveiller le chalumeau en activité considérait ce calme obscur il interrogeait l horizon et comme il arrive aux esprits inquiets ou prévenus son regard croyait parfois surprendre de vagues lueurs",
		"son temps le plus paisible fut celui où on le prit pour un fou il s était familiarisé avec les idiomes de ces contrées il catéchisait",
		"il fit une esquisse très réussie de la campagne environnante avec la longue prairie à perte de vue la forêt de camaldores et le ballon immobile sur le corps du monstrueux éléphant",
		"parfait dit joe nyam",
		"je veux dire que le nouveau victoria ne vaut pas l ancien soit que le tissu en ait été trop éprouvé soit que la gutta percha se soit fondue à la chaleur du serpentin je constate une certaine déperdition de gaz ce n est pas grand chose jusqu ici mais enfin c est appréciable nous avons une tendance à baisser et pour me maintenir je suis forcé de donner plus de dilatation à l hydrogène",
		"aussi quand le docteur conçut ce projet de traverser l afrique par les airs ce fut pour joe chose faite il n existait plus d obstacles dès l instant que le docteur fergusson avait résolu de partir il était arrivé avec son fidèle serviteur car ce brave garçon sans en avoir jamais parlé savait bien qu il serait du voyage",
		"nos efforts se borneront donc à nous maintenir sur cette vaste étendue d eau pendant toute la journée",
		"mais il en restait en tout trois gallons treize litres et demi environ",
		"s il venait à être rejeté vers le niger que deviendrait il",
		"ah",
		"le docteur fergusson consulta le baromètre il donna douze mille pieds d élévation",
		"mais au fait leur présence dans cette oasis peut faire supposer que nous ne sommes pas très éloignés de contrées plus fertiles",
		"la population de kazeh comprenant que sa proie lui échappait poussa des hurlements prolongés des arcs des mousquets furent dirigés vers le ballon",
		"diable",
		"dit joe qui s écriait volontiers vive quelque chose quand il était en joie",
		"pas avant de les avoir déchargés du moins répondit le chasseur",
		"la descente se fait naturellement en modérant la chaleur du chalumeau et en laissant la température se refroidir",
		"mais que voulez vous",
		"il y avait une telle énergie dans son geste que joe et kennedy se séparèrent et tous deux regardèrent",
		"en voilà un assaut",
		"loin de cette terre dont il n avait jamais connu les joies au milieu de cette nuit qui lui jetait ses plus douces clartés sur le chemin de ce ciel vers lequel il s élevait comme dans une assomption miraculeuse il semblait déjà revivre de l existence nouvelle",
		"je suis prêt",
		"le sol devient montueux et fait pressentir de prochaines montagnes",
		"je lui devais bien cela depuis l affaire de l arabe",
		"et pendant que ses compagnons sommeillaient il porta à une haute température l hydrogène de l aérostat celui ci s arrondit sous la dilatation du gaz et monta droit dans les rayons perpendiculaires du soleil",
		"s écria le chasseur notre sauveur",
		"je ne poursuis pas mon chemin disait il souvent c est mon chemin qui me poursuit",
		"des cris épouvantables éclatèrent sous la forêt avec de violentes détonations d armes à feu le ballon pris par un courant qui se levait avec le jour se porta vers l ouest il était quatre heures du matin",
		"cette opération prit quatre heures au moins mais enfin le ballon intérieur entièrement dégagé parut n avoir aucunement souffert",
		"les voyageurs se rendaient parfaitement compte de la conformation orographique du pays",
		"voyons dit joe en s armant de l un des fusils il faut que je vous aide monsieur dick ou cela n en finira pas",
		"les voyageurs que cet incident avait arrachés à leurs préoccupations retombèrent dans de tristes pensées accablés par une chaleur dévorante",
		"mais bientôt cette image s effaça graduellement les nuages s élevèrent à une plus grande hauteur abandonnant le victoria qui n essaya plus de les suivre et au bout d une heure ils disparurent en plein ciel",
		"et comment feras tu",
		"au dessus de lui la voûte azurée était pure mais on la sentait lourde",

		"mais non répondit le docteur fergusson il y en a peu ou point",
		"joe plongea une bouteille et la ramena à demi pleine cette eau fut goûtée et trouvée peu potable avec un certain goût de natron",
		"eh bien nous rendrons visite à jupiter un drôle de pays allez où les journées ne sont que de neuf heures et demie ce qui est commode pour les paresseux et où les années par exemple durent douze ans ce qui est avantageux pour les gens qui n ont plus que six mois à vivre",
		"nous en aurions vite fait le tour répondit le chasseur et sauf ces aimables insectes on n y aperçoit pas un être vivant",

		"toute cette eau en contenait une quantité considérable et en la décomposant par nos puissantes piles elle nous eût restitué le fluide vivifiant",
		"au fait dit conseil allons nous du bon côté",
		"cet et coetera ne saurait empêcher de citer encore un poisson dont conseil se souviendra longtemps et pour cause",
		"a neuf heures nous accostions la terre",
		"le canadien resta quelques instants sans répondre",
		"conseil plus prudent ou plus solide ne bronchait guère et me relevait disant si monsieur voulait avoir la bonté d écarter les jambes monsieur conserverait mieux son équilibre",
		"la famille des totipalmes était représentée par des frégates rapides qui pêchaient prestement les poissons de la surface et par de nombreux phaétons ou paille en queue entre autres ce phaéton à brins rouges gros comme un pigeon et dont le plumage blanc est nuancé de tons roses qui font valoir la teinte noire des ailes",
		"vers le soir il flottait déjà sous l immense carapace glacée de la banquise",
		"il n a pas la queue bifurquée comme les baleines ou les cachalots et ses nageoires ressemblent à des membres tronqués",
		"en tout cas répondit le canadien nous serions déjà dégagés car nous flottons",
		"il n est pas un savant comme monsieur et ne saurait prendre le même goût que nous aux choses admirables de la mer",
		"plus rien jusqu au moment où dans une éclaircie j aperçus l audacieux capitaine cramponné à l une des nageoires de l animal luttant corps à corps avec le monstre labourant de coups de poignard le ventre de son ennemi sans pouvoir toutefois porter le coup définitif c est à dire l atteindre en plein coeur",
		"monsieur me dit ce jour là ned land si votre capitaine va plus loin",
		"lorsque le nautilus était immergé au moment où se rompaient ces équilibres le bruit se propageait sous les eaux avec une effrayante intensité et la chute de ces masses créait de redoutables remous jusque dans les couches profondes de l océan",
		"votre existence valait plus que la nôtre",
		"l air ne pouvait plus être renouvelé à l intérieur du nautilus",
		"le temps était clair l atmosphère assez pure le froid très vif douze degrés au dessous de zéro mais le vent s étant calmé cette température ne semblait pas trop insupportable",
		"c est à ce moment que commence le double travail des rogueurs",
		"monsieur aronnax dit le capitaine nemo je vous répondrai aujourd hui ce que je vous ai répondu il y a sept mois qui entre dans le nautilus ne doit plus le quitter",
		"mais le matin quand revêtu de mon scaphandre je parcourus la masse liquide par une température de six à sept degrés au dessous de zéro je remarquai que les murailles latérales se rapprochaient peu à peu",
		"mais cloué par l horreur je ne pouvais remuer",
		"puis ses hommes la taraudèrent simultanément sur plusieurs points de sa circonférence",
		"le vaisseau nous restait à un mille et demi et avec les première lueurs du jour sa canonnade recommença",
		"et qui vous dit qu il fera le tour de l afrique monsieur le professeur",
		"je compris que le nautilus venait de s arrêter sur le fond de l océan",
		"non répondit le canadien puisque celui ci est entier et que l autre a perdu sa queue",
		"et voici pourquoi suivant le savant maury l auteur de la géographie physique du globe ces hydrophytes se réunissent dans ce paisible bassin de l atlantique l explication qu on en peut donner dit il me semble résulter d une expérience connue de tout le monde",
		"ce sera chose facile",
		"dis je c est un admirable spectacle",
		"le soir nous avions franchi deux cents lieues de l atlantique",
		"cette épave pour être ainsi encroûtée dans le calcaire des eaux comptait déjà bien des années passées sur ce fond de l océan",
		"restez mes amis dis je en les retenant",
		"j estimai qu il contenait alors plus de mille kilogrammes d or c est à dire près de cinq millions de francs",
		"l exploitation annuelle n est pas encore commencée",
		"j ouvris ma porte avec précaution et cependant il me sembla qu en tournant sur ses gonds elle faisait un bruit effrayant",
		"mais lorsque je fus revenu à bord",
		"quelques uns de ces carets lorsqu on les prit dormaient encore dans leur carapace à l abri des animaux marins",
		"demanda conseil",
		"aspects incessamment variés par les obliques rayons du soleil ou perdus dans les brumes grises au milieu des ouragans de neige",
		"j éprouvais une insurmontable horreur pour le capitaine nemo",
		"le canadien était évidemment à bout de patience",
		"enfin voilà un fait dit ned land",
		"je restai seul",
		"le capitaine nemo vit il encore",
		"je ne pouvais admettre cependant qu il eût reconnu le nautilus à cette distance encore moins qu il sût ce qu était cet engin sous marin",
		"dans ces conditions le baromètre se tint généralement très bas",
		"mais tel n est pas le cas et à vous parler franchement je ne crois pas que le capitaine nemo s aventure jamais dans les mers européennes",
		"là entre les plis foliacés je vis une perle libre dont la grosseur égalait celle d une noix de cocotier",
		"le rôle joué par la baleine dans le monde marin et son influence sur les découvertes géographiques ont été considérables",
		"ils se plaignirent donc à madrid et ils obtinrent du faible philippe v que le convoi sans procéder à son déchargement resterait en séquestre dans la rade de vigo jusqu au moment où les flottes ennemies se seraient éloignées",
		"aussitôt un de ces longs bras se glissa comme un serpent par l ouverture et vingt autres s agitèrent au dessus",
		"vous n avez encore visité les fonds sous marins que le jour et sous la clarté du soleil",
		"la première s est terminée sur cette émouvante scène du cimetière de corail qui a laissé dans mon esprit une impression profonde",
		"le seul parti était de se soumettre mais ce qu on ne devait plus attendre de la force ou de la ruse j aimais à penser qu on pourrait l obtenir par la persuasion",
		"seul le capitaine connaissait la grotte où mûrissait cet admirable fruit de la nature seul il l élevait pour ainsi dire afin de la transporter un jour dans son précieux musée",
		"nous ne sommes pas même prisonniers sur parole",
		"minuit approchait",
		"j éprouvais un malaise insupportable",
		"quelque épais que soient les nuages ils ne peuvent l obscurcir",
		"j observai que les fonds méditerranéens étaient plus encombrés de ces sinistres épaves à mesure que le nautilus se rapprochait du détroit de gibraltar",
		"euro rdquo et vous tenteriez de vous sauver à la nage",
		"sous cette mer libre le nautilus avait pris directement le chemin de pôle sans s écarter du cinquante deuxième méridien",
		"est ce que nous avons touché",
		"le faisceau de fils conducteurs isolés dans une enveloppe de gutta percha était protégé par un matelas de matières textiles contenu dans une armature métallique",
		"parce qu on le sait",
		"aures habent et non audient est de tous les temps",
		"avez vous fait quelque découverte qui m ait échappé",
		"xix le gulf stream cette terrible scène du avril aucun de nous ne pourra jamais l oublier",
		"c était à la hauteur de saint jean de terre neuve et de heart s content où aboutit l extrémité du câble transatlantique",
		"non",
		"c étaient des hurlements de joie non de colère",
		"un phare flottant dit on près de moi",
		"je frappai à sa porte",
		"c étaient des phoques d espèces diverses les uns étendus sur le sol les autres couchés sur des glaçons en dérive plusieurs sortant de la mer ou y rentrant",
		"ni femme ni parents ni enfants ne l attendent au pays",
		"cent cinquante pieds nous séparaient alors de la surface des eaux",
		"sa physionomie habituellement si impassible révélait une certaine inquiétude",
		"quel peut être cet animal",
		"les glaces nous entouraient de toutes parts et fermaient l horizon",
		"jamais je n ai promené mon nautilus aussi loin sur les mers australes mais je vous le répète il ira plus loin encore",
		"la surface du long cigare de tôle n offrait plus une seule saillie qui pût gêner sa manoeuvre",
		"c étaient des balistes américains pour lesquels la nature n a broyé que du blanc et du noir des bobies plumiers allongés et charnus aux nageoires jaunes à la mâchoire proéminente des scombres de seize décimètres à dents courtes et aiguës couverts de petites écailles appartenant à l espèce des albicores",
		"dans le quatre vingt neuvième genre des poissons classés par lacépède qui appartient à la seconde sous classe des osseux caractérisés par un opercule et une membrane bronchiale je remarquai la scorpène dont la tête est garnie d aiguillons et qui ne possède qu une seule nageoire dorsale ces animaux sont revêtus ou privés de petites écailles suivant le sous genre auquel ils appartiennent",
		"cependant la vitesse du nautilus s accrut sensiblement",
		"et pourquoi le dit on",
		"pas un poisson pas un oiseau des plus rapides qui soient ne pouvaient nous suivre et les curiosités naturelles de ces mers échappèrent à toute observation",
		"rien que la mer immense",
		"mais chacun l avait envisagée en face et tous étaient décidés à faire leur devoir jusqu au bout",
		"ses lèvres serrées ses sourcils froncés indiquaient chez lui la violente obsession d une idée fixe",
		"et me voilà rêvant de requins songeant à ces vastes mâchoires armées de multiples rangées de dents et capables de couper un homme en deux",
		"il gravit un roc qui terminait en surplomb un petit promontoire et là les bras croisés le regard ardent immobile muet il sembla prendre possession de ces régions australes",
		"c est ce qu on appelle une mer de lait lui dis je vaste étendue de flots blancs qui se voit fréquemment sur les côtes d amboine et dans ces parages",
		"plusieurs fois je crus que le nautilus se disposait pour l attaque",
		"je m élançai vers la plate forme",
		"les volcans si nombreux aux premiers jours du monde s éteignent peu à peu la chaleur interne s affaiblit la température des couches inférieures du globe baisse d une quantité appréciable par siècle et au détriment de notre globe car cette chaleur c est sa vie",
		"nous flottons dans un courant d eau bouillante",
		"en ce moment le fanal s alluma soudain et son vif éclat fit évanouir cette vague lumière",
		"soudain un mouvement de recul se produisit dans le tumulte robur après avoir retiré ses mains de ses poches les tendait vers les premiers rangs de ces acharnés",
		"tom turner s était mis au gouvernail",
		"ainsi raisonnaient le président et le secrétaire du weldon institute maintenant entraînés à l extrémité de ce continent du nouveau monde qui est toujours l amérique mais non celle des etats unis",
		"eh bien",
		"eh bien un kilogramme dudit robur devait en produire au moins dix",
		"aucun de ceux qui l accompagnaient n avait pu lui survivre",
		"oui",
		"tous deux se glissèrent sur la plate forme s arrêtant parfois à l abri des roufles pour écouter si quelque bruit se produisait",
		"et combien de caravanes périssent dans ces tourbillons",
		"quant à robur il avait manœuvré l appareil sans que son sang froid l eût abandonné un instant",
		"on laissait faire l animal en se maintenant en ligue avec lui",
		"greenwich ne parvint pas à s entendre avec oxford bien que tous deux soutinssent qu il n y avait rien",
		"ses hélices suspensives il semblait qu il eût pu s en passer",
		"il ne sera pas dit que l albatros n aura pas essayé de venir à leur secours",
		"mais auparavant ils rentrèrent dans leur cabine et prirent sur eux tout ce qu ils pouvaient emporter en prévision d un séjour plus ou moins prolongé sur l île chatam",
		"voilà qui est rassurant",
		"cet ensemble de toits à l horizon c est chicago",
		"non évidemment",
		"décidément il avait du bon cet aéronef qui pouvait ainsi secourir des marins perdus en mer",
		"mais avant cette soirée jamais ce tumulte n avait pris de telles proportions jamais les plaintes n eussent été plus fondées jamais l intervention des policemen plus nécessaire",
		"miss doll et miss mat forbes si attachées à uncle prudent par les liens de la plus pure amitié ne pouvaient revenir de cette disparition et afin d obtenir des nouvelles de l absent parlaient encore plus que d habitude",
		"d ailleurs ainsi enfermé il ne voyait rien de ce qui se passait au dehors et pouvait se croire à l abri du danger",
		"mais ce rideau de brumes s étant déchiré on aperçut une immense cité avec palais villas chalets jardins parcs",
		"en quoi il a raison",
		"comment eût il pu renouveler ses approvisionnements en vivres et munitions sans parler des substances nécessaires au fonctionnement des machines",
		"s écria uncle prudent",
		"quel reflet d azur projeté par ce gigantesque miroir",
		"xvii dans lequel on revient à deux mois en arrière et où l on saute à neuf mois en avant",
		"a dix heures du soir l albatros venait d atteindre les côtes de france à peu près à la hauteur de dunkerque",
		"sans l évaporation qui lui enlève son trop plein ce trou d une superficie de dix sept mille lieues carrées d une profondeur moyenne comprise entre soixante et quatre cents pieds aurait inondé les côtes du nord et de l est basses et marécageuses",
		"enfin les vingt sept premiers jours de septembre s écoulèrent sans résultat",
		"a l avant il avait trouvé une forte soupe de ce pain",
		"allons donc",
		"ils ne cherchaient que l occasion de s enfuir",
		"n était ce pas une insulte d autant plus impardonnable qu elle tombait juste historiquement",
		"ils n étaient qu à quelques mètres de la surface de l hydaspe à portée des rives",
		"se sentir ainsi emportés dans l inconnu ne pas entrevoir l issue d une pareille aventure douter même si jamais elle aurait une fin être condamnés à l aviation perpétuelle n y avait il pas de quoi pousser à quelque extrémité terrible le président et le secrétaire du weldon institute",
		"on nous surveille même quand nous ne croyons pas être surveillés répondit uncle prudent",
		"cela nous permettra sans doute de pêcher",
		"les fanaux s éteignirent car le courant électrique leur manqua subitement et l obscurité redevint complète",
		"des sommes considérables furent promises par annonces et affiches non seulement à qui retrouverait les honorables disparus mais à quiconque pourrait produire quelque indice de nature à mettre sur leurs traces",
		"si ça cassait",
		"du coup la politique fut par terre et les affaires n en allèrent pas plus mal",
		"il n était pas jusqu au port de kabara situé dans le coude du niger où le personnel des flottilles ne fût en mouvement",
		"murmura phil evans",
		"j ajoute que la nuit excepté le timonier posté à l arrière personne ne veille",
		"mais d où vient ce frémissement qui ne cesse pas",
		"voilà pour le physique",
		"des milliards",
		"on fouilla la schuylkill river on en racla le fond on ébarba les rives de leur amas d herbes",
		"cette ville que nous laissons en arrière c est québec",
		"le lendemain elle fut ramassée par une honnête balayeuse qui s empressa de la porter à la préfecture de police",
		"demanda le secrétaire phil evans",
		"phil evans donna un violent coup du manche de son bowie knife sur la vitre qui rendit un son argentin mais ne cassa pas",
		"mais robur ne savait plus où il se trouvait alors par suite de cet affolement de l aiguille aimantée dans le voisinage du pôle magnétique",
		"d ailleurs quand bien même toutes ces conditions se fussent alors rencontrées le projet n aurait pas pu être mis à exécution ce jour là du moins",
		"il passa outre",
		"le mouvement s accéléra peu à peu et l albatros évoluant cap au sud ouest revint avec une vitesse moyenne dans la direction de l île chatam",
		"en outre il y avait à bord une légère embarcation en caoutchouc insubmersible qui pouvait porter huit hommes à la surface d un fleuve d un lac ou d une mer calme",
		"demanda l ingénieur",
		"phil evans",
		"quant aux piles aux accumulateurs rien de tout ce qui produisait la force mécanique de l albatros n avait souffert des violences du cyclone",
		"il fallait donc pratiquer un trou et s échapper par ce trou",
		"quant à l albatros voyage t il encore à travers cette atmosphère terrestre au milieu de ce domaine que nul ne peut lui ravir",
		"dans les chantiers turner à philadelphie s allongeait un énorme aérostat dont la solidité allait être éprouvée en y comprimant de l air sous une forte pression",
		"une circonférence d un mètre de diamètre formant parachute peut non seulement modérer une descente dans l air mais aussi la rendre isochrone",
		"uncle prudent et phil evans voyaient peu robur",
		"mais il ne sera pas perdu pour l humanité",
		"les fonds affluèrent sans qu il fût même nécessaire de constituer une société par actions",
		"plate forme",
		"tout juste âgé de vingt et un ans c est dire qu il n avait jamais été esclave pas même de naissance mais il n en valait guère mieux",
		"mais pourquoi le vent manquait il à cette magnifique expérience",
		"peut être",
		"répondit l ingénieur",
		"passant entre le mont tam de la presqu île de brunswik et le mont graves il se dirigea droit vers le mont sarmiento pic énorme encapuchonné de glaces qui domine le détroit de magellan à deux mille mètres au dessus du niveau de la mer",
		"faut il avouer enfin que le plus grand nombre des curieux n était peut être pas venu pour voir le go a head mais pour contempler ces deux hommes extraordinaires que l ancien monde enviait au nouveau",
		"certes personne ne songeait à établir une connexité entre cette réapparition si singulière et la disparition non moins inexplicable des deux membres du weldon institute",
		"maintenant vers quel point du globe allait se diriger l albatros etait il admissible qu en plein hiver il osât s aventurer au dessus des mers australes ou des continents du pôle",
		"dit robur",
		"c est ce que robur démontra avec une indéniable logique au milieu du brouhaha qui s élevait de toutes parts",
		"le ils arrivaient à philadelphie",
		"avec ses franges argentées ses lamelles qui rayonnaient à travers l espace ce météore présentait la forme d un immense éventail ouvert sur une moitié du ciel",
		"frycollin ne se doutait guère qu il allait en être le provocateur",
		"on eût dit d un concert de harpes éoliennes",
		"or l île chatam est peu fréquentée des navigateurs",
		"en tout cas leur président avait quelque peine à les diriger eux mêmes",
		"le domaine du pôle austral comprend dit on quatre millions cinq cent mille mètres carrés en superficie",
		"aussi l albatros exact comme un express atteignit il pétersbourg et les bords de la neva vers deux heures du matin",
		"situation embarrassante qui aurait pu durer plus que la vie des deux candidats",
		"de ces nuages s échappaient des protubérances allongées dont la pointe semblait attirer l eau qui bouillonnait au dessous en forme de buisson liquide",
		"ce furent d abord le kouen loun puis le karakoroum qui dessinent cette vallée longitudinale et parallèle à l himalaya presque à la ligne de faite où se partagent les bassins de l indus à l ouest et du brahmapoutre à l est",
		"et si l accord s était si rapidement fait sur ce nom singulier c est que le weldon institute espérait bien décharger sur celui qui le portait le trop plein de son exaspération",
		"le brouillard dura trois jours les juin avec une persistance regrettable",
		"elle était ouverte",
		"par un temps calme cette vitesse les eût considérablement gênés puisque c est à peu près celle d un express",
		"de quel pays venait ce remarquable type",
		"examen fait il fut constaté qu il y avait en suspension dans l air de petits cristaux de pyroxène des globules vitreux de fines particules de fer magnétique analogues aux matières que rejettent certaines montagnes ignivomes",
		"répondit le maître coq",
		"certaines portions de rives très escarpées sont revêtues d une toison d arbres verts pins et mélèzes et du pied de ces escarpements jaillissent d innombrables fumerolles blanches",
		"il risquait donc d être entraîné fort loin dans le nord est ce qui retarderait son retour à l île chatam",
		"la capture des prisonniers ne pouvait donc faire question et une fois repris on ne s enfuit pas de l île x",
		"en tout cas ce n était pas le moment",
		"ça ne mord pas phil evans",
		"le président laissa l enthousiasme s épuiser en clameurs et en battements de mains",
		"ce sont les plus redoutables cétacés des mers boréales",
		"puis repoussant le coffre sous la couchette maintenant à l arrière dit il et attendons",
		"ne faut il pas de nombreux messagers pour rassembler non seulement les esprits mais tous les hôtes du ciel conviés à faire cortège au monarque divinisé",
		"illusion d optique",
		"il fut alors constant qu il se relevait vers l est en s écartant de la platte river dont la vallée est suivie par le pacifiquerailway à travers la prairie",
		"et bientôt la violence de l ouragan devint telle que robur crut devoir réduire les propulseurs au minimum de tours afin d éviter quelques graves avaries et de manière à pouvoir gouverner tout en conservant le moins possible de vitesse propre",
		"peut être suffirait il de faire un trou pour l ouvrir par l extérieur si elle n était maintenue que par un verrou ou si la clef avait été laissée dans la serrure",
		"attention",
		"on le voit les deux collègues étaient d accord sur tous les points même quand il s agissait d accepter avec cette indifférence l effroyable mort qui les attendait",
		"et quand frycollin rapportait ces propos à son maître celui ci voyait bien qu il ne pourrait obtenir aucun renseignement sur robur",
		"peut être",
		"un homme en effet était couché près du roufle",
		"de ces divers phénomènes pouvait on conclure à un prochain changement de temps",
		"evidemment ce robur s était douté de ce qui allait se passer au club il prévoyait les colères que son attitude provocante devait soulever il avait placé à la porte quelques uns de ses bandits pour lui prêter main forte",
		"enfin le soir venu l aéronef dépassait moscou sans même saluer le drapeau du kremlin",
		"vers six heures les deux collègues dînèrent suivant leur habitude",
		"uncle prudent dit phil evans il paraît que cet étonnant albatros n a jamais rien à craindre",
		"au contraire",
		"faire part aux amis et connaissances",
		"en vain les deux prisonniers voulurent ils profiter de l occasion qui leur était offerte de faire connaître ce qu ils étaient devenus",
		"l albatros n aurait rien eu à craindre d une semblable collision",
		"pendant la nuit le brouillard se dissipa",
		"un transatlantique ne leur eût point offert plus de confort",
		"a un geste de lui tom turner et quelques uns de ses camarades étaient accourus",
		"et après",
		"un réseau de feu barrait la route",
		"nuit sombre et sans lune",
		"les malheureux se jetèrent dessus et burent à même avec une avidité qui faisait mal à voir",
		"uncle prudent et phil evans auraient reparu dans l après midi au domicile particulier du président du weldon institute",
		"y avait il donc quelque choc à redouter avec un appareil de même sorte",
		"en effet pas d air pas de bruit et comme il y avait bruit toujours la fameuse trompette",
		"pendant cette matinée l albatros plana au dessus de srinagar plus connue sous le nom de cachemir",
		"mais en ce moment nous voici sur la caspienne",
		"qu on y songe",
		"fit il",
		"les uns avaient entendu le yankee doodle les autres le rule britannia",
		"demanda uncle prudent",
		"cela est sage",
		"les flammes de l erebus couchées par la tempête lui livrèrent passage",
		"les membres du club puis leurs amis puis la foule se portèrent devant la maison de uncle prudent",
		"du bois de fer alors",
		"c est là peut être qu ils attendaient l ingénieur",
		"mais ce fut bien une autre affaire lorsque toute la ville apprit que le président et le secrétaire du club eux aussi avaient disparu pendant la nuit du au juin",
		"mais ni l un ni l autre ne voulurent rien laisser paraître de cet ahurissement si naturel",
		"on utilisa ce qui pouvait servir de l ancien aéronef ses propulseurs entre autres engins qui avaient été embarqués avec tous les débris sur la goélette",
		"grands bouquets d arbres au plus épais des taillis rien",
		"mais cela est",
		"donc toutes ces explications n expliquaient rien tous ces observateurs observaient mal",
		"eh",
		"messieurs tombouctou",
		"quant à cette trompette on essaya vainement de mettre son éclatante fanfare au rang des illusions d acoustique",
		"en tout cas c était là un fait que les journaux de l union allaient commenter",
		"il lui fallait de l audace à coup sûr puisqu il soumettait sa personne à une telle épreuve",
		"ne se seraient ils point absentés par hasard",
		"que de fois il y avait puisé la prise de l amitié",
		"en somme le hasard fit que le président et le secrétaire du weldon institute sans s en douter se dirigeaient vers fairmont park",
		"au mois de décembre je voyageais en afrique avec mon fils auguste maquet louis boulanger giraud et desbarolles",
		"j envoie cet article à l impression mais avant qu il soit imprimé je m attends à recevoir le récit de quelque nouveau sauvetage de fosse",

		"je passai plus d une heure la tête appuyée dans ma main pendant cette heure tous les fantômes de mes vingt premières années évoqués par ma volonté reparurent devant moi les uns rayonnants comme si je les avais vus la veille les autres dans la demi teinte les autres pareils à des ombres voilées",

		"j étois dans l ivresse auprès de vous et quand je me suis rappelé notre soirée je n ai éprouvé qu une inquiétude une tristesse indéfinissable",
		"il y aura encore de l amour après moi il y aura des coeurs qui seront heureux qu ai je dit hélas",
		"ma figure se conserva assez tard néanmoins depuis l âge de trente ans j avois commencé à réfléchir sur le petit nombre d années dont il me restoit à jouir je m étonnai d une impression qui m étoit tout à fait nouvelle je craignois l avenir au lieu de le désirer je ne faisois plus de projets je retenois les jours au lieu de les hâter",
		"madame d albémar a reçu une lettre de léonce qui l a un peu calmée à ce que je crois car au milieu de nous elle a eu quelque retour de cet esprit aimable et piquant qui la rend si séduisante",
		"où le nom d ami si légèrement prodigué n impose pas le devoir de défendre et donne seulement plus de moyens de nuire si l on abandonne",

		"et sans cette certitude combien le parti que j ai adopté seroit insensé",

		"enfin je le crois il existe dans le monde une classe de personnes qui souffrent et jouissent uniquement par les affections du coeur et dont l existence tout intérieure est à peine comprise par le commun des hommes je crois que delphine doit être utile à ces sortes de personnes surtout si elles joignent à de la sensibilité l imagination active et douloureuse qui multiplie les regrets sur le passé et les craintes pour l avenir",

		"tant de douceur et de sensibilité se peignit alors sur son visage que j oubliai entièrement l opinion que j avois eue de lui et qui pouvoit garantir mon coeur",
		"enfin il faut trouver dans l objet de nos sacrifices la source toujours vive des jouissances variées du coeur et de la raison et traverser la vie appuyés l un sur l autre en s aimant et faisant le bien",

		"et l amour ne peut il être combattu que par des fantômes superstitieux qui remplissent notre âme de terreur",
		"puisqu il est vrai que l amour existe dans le coeur tout ce qui tend à l élever et à l ennoblir contribue à la dignité de la nature humaine les mariages les plus heureux même dans la vieillesse sont ceux qui de souvenirs en souvenirs retentissent jusqu à l amour",
		"je me croyois mieux ma soeur la dernière fois que je vous ai écrit aujourd hui les circonstances les plus simples telles qu il en naîtra chaque jour de semblables ont rempli mon âme d amertume le fond triste et sombre sur lequel repose ma destinée ne peut varier et cependant ma douleur se renouvelle sous mille formes et chacune d elles exige un nouveau combat pour en triompher",
		"l imparfaite destinée jette toujours des regrets à travers les plus pures jouissances la peine que j éprouve la seule de ma vie me garantit peut être la possession de tout ce qui m est cher elle m acquitte envers la douleur qui ne veut pas qu on l oublie et j obtiendrai peut être en compensation le seul bien que je demande maintenant au ciel mourir avant henri recevoir ses soins à ma dernière heure entendre sa douce voix me remercier de l avoir rendu heureux de l avoir préféré à tout sur cette terre alors j aurai vécu de la vraie destinée pour laquelle les femmes sont faites aimer encore aimer et rendre enfin au dieu qui nous l a donnée une âme que les affections sensibles auront seules occupée",
		"me répondit il rien ne peut affoiblir la passion que j ai pour toi et cette passion à présent me fait mal toujours mal tes yeux qui s élèvent vers le ciel comme vers ta patrie tes yeux implorent la force de me résister delphine dans ces étoiles que tu contemples dans ces mondes peut être habités s il y a des êtres qui s aiment ils se réunissent les hommes la société leurs vertus même ne les séparent point cruel",
		"nous connoissons bien peu nos rapports avec l être suprême mais sans doute il sait trop bien quelle est notre nature pour accepter jamais des engagemens irrévocables",
		"non j ose l affirmer le coeur humain n a pas cette force",

		"l ambassadeur d espagne s approchant de lui comme il parloit il dit à très haute voix que depuis six semaines il n avoit point vu m de mondoville et qu il n étoit pas retourné chez sa mère",
		"avant hier au bal madame du marset placée à côté de lui n a cessé de lui parler bas pendant que thérèse dansoit avec m de serbellane je ne crois point que madame du marset ait été capable d exciter positivement les soupçons de m d ervins les caractères les plus méchans ne veulent pas s avouer qu ils le sont et se réservent toujours quelques moyens d excuse vis à vis des autres et d eux mêmes mais j ai cru reconnoître par quelques mots échappés à la fureur de m d ervins que madame du marset en apprenant que m de serbellane avoit passé six mois dans son château avec sa femme s étoit moquée du rôle ridicule qu il devoit avoir joué en tiers avec ces deux jeunes gens et de tous les mots qu elle pouvoit choisir le plus perfide étoit celui de ridicule depuis m d ervins l a répété sans cesse dans sa fureur et quand elle s apaisoit il lui suffisoit de se le prononcer à lui même pour qu elle recommençât plus violente que jamais",
		"mais elle m a nommée dites vous j ai dû venir",
		"ah",
		"comment pourrois je d ailleurs être assurée de la garder près de moi si elle ne le prenoit pas",
		"puis je cultiver mon esprit quand il n est plus capable d une attention suivie",
		"me dit encore delphine vous croyez impossible de consoler léonce de fortifier assez son âme pour qu il puisse consacrer sa vie à la gloire et à la vertu",
		"vous que j ai vue trop disposée à la dédaigner vous lui sacrifiez votre vie tout entière quel délire de passion",
		"et moi qui me crois plus éclairée que deviendrai je",
		"hier en sortant du bal léonce impatienté de ce que la foule empêchoit sa voiture d avancer se décida à l aller chercher à pied au bout de la rue il éprouvoit il en convient beaucoup d humeur de ce que diverses personnes lui avoient annoncé mon mariage avec m de valorbe comme très probable",
		"a quelques pas de là il retrouva ses gens on lui remit ma lettre et il confesse qu il fut très honteux en la lisant de son impétuosité mais il déclare en même temps à ma belle soeur qu il ne faut pas penser à en prévenir les suites",
		"si vous répondez à léonce si vous l instruisez de la vérité vous ne ferez peut être rien de vraiment mal rien que personne surtout pût se permettre de condamner mais si pour mieux assurer son repos domestique si pour l éloigner plus sûrement de vous vous vous taisez vous aurez surpassé de beaucoup ce que l on pourroit attendre de la vertu la plus sévère",
		"ce septembre",
		"je parlois encore à léonce lorsque j appris subitement qu on emportoit madame d ervins sans connoissance je courus après son mari qui la suivoit je montai dans sa voiture presque malgré lui et je pris dans mes bras la pauvre thérèse qui étoit tombée dans un évanouissement si profond qu elle ne donnoit plus un signe de vie grand dieu",
		"ne me demandez pas de vous rejoindre il faut que je vive seule pour écarter de vous une destinée chaque jour plus malheureuse",
		"elle me glace à l instant où je l aperçois je n ai plus ni les armes de mon esprit ni celles de mon caractère devant les méchans ce n est point par foiblesse vous savez si je manque de courage quand il s agit de défendre mes amis mais j ai peur de ceux qui me haïssent parce que je ne sais pas leur opposer un sentiment de même nature et les larmes me viennent plus facilement que les expressions méprisantes quand je me vois l objet de cet actif besoin de nuire qui remplit les vies désoeuvrées",
		"je reconnus ma lettre qu elle regardoit encore j allois m en saisir pour la déchirer lorsque delphine reprenant ses forces s avança vers moi et tenant ma lettre dans l une de ses mains elle leva l autre vers le ciel",
		"prêt à te posséder je te perdrois",
		"quand tu n avois pas encore troublé mes espérances quand je me flattois de passer ma vie entière avec toi il n existoit pas dans l imagination un bonheur que l on pût comparer au mien aucun chagrin aucune inquiétude ne me rendoient les heures difficiles je me sentois portée dans la vie comme sur un nuage à peine touchois je la terre de mes pas j étois environnée d un air azuré à travers lequel tous les objets s offroient à moi sous une couleur riante si je lisois mes yeux se remplissoient des plus douces larmes à chaque mot que je rapportois à toi je m attendrissois en faisant de la musique car je t adressois toujours ce langage mystérieux ces émotions indéfinissables que l harmonie nous fait éprouver j avois en moi une existence surnaturelle que tu m avois donnée une inspiration d amour et de vertu qui faisoit battre mon coeur plus vite à tous les momens du jour",
		"un domestique entra pendant que je faisois ces réflexions il portoit un billet à la main et je ne doutai pas que ce billet ne fût l excuse de léonce",
		"je sais cependant que si rien de nouveau ne traverse ma vie je me tirerai de ma situation actuelle je me replacerai dans la société au rang que j y occupois et que léonce regrette si vivement",
		"vous avez le droit de m accabler de mes défauts après le malheur dans lequel ils m ont précipité cependant deviez vous me dire que je vous aimerois moins si votre réputation étoit altérée si elle l étoit par votre condescendance même pour mon bonheur",
		"eh bien",
		"oh",
		"c est ainsi que dans tous les genres la vérité est à la fois ce qu il y a de plus difficile et de plus simple de plus sublime et de plus naturel",
		"je ne sais quels cris de douleur échappèrent de mon sein ils excitèrent dans le coeur de m de valorbe un mouvement impétueux qui le précipita à mes pieds quoi",
		"je puis au milieu des événemens actuels me trouver engagé quoiqu à regret dans une guerre civile et certainement je servirais alors dans un parti contraire à celui de m de lebensei",
		"ces mots terribles que m d ervins a prononcés au bal ces mots vous ne le verrez plus retentissent toujours dans son coeur en les répétant elle est dans un tel état qu il semble qu avec ces seules paroles on pourroit lui donner la mort elle dit que si ce sort jeté sur elle ne s accomplit pas si elle revoit encore une fois m de serbellane elle sera sûre que leur séparation ne doit point être éternelle elle aura la force de supporter son départ mais que si ce dernier adieu n est pas accordé elle ne peut répondre d y survivre",
		"livrons nous à l amour qui nous inspire ne laissons pas le froid de la pensée nous gagner je t en conjure n hésite plus ne tarde plus insensé que vous êtes",
		"tout ce qui remue au dehors me plaît tout ce qui agite au dedans m est odieux je suis incapable de vives jouissances et par cette raison même je déteste la peine je l ai évitée avec un soin constant et une volonté inébranlable",
		"ma cousine où en serions nous si toutes les femmes prenoient ainsi pour guide ce qu elles appelleroient leurs lumières",
		"m de mondoville à m de lebensei",
		"vous n avez pas un moment à perdre pour lui donner la satisfaction de vous revoir et pour contribuer au salut de son âme car je ne doute pas que malgré nos différences d opinion vous ne vous joigniez à moi pour l engager à remplir les devoirs sacrés dont dépend son bonheur à venir c est le premier intérêt dont je veux vous parler vous lui ferez plus d impression que moi si vous vous joignez à mes instances vous ne voulez pas j en suis sûre exposer ma pauvre mère à mourir sans avoir reçu les secours de la religion",
		"ce septembre me pardonner",
		"j eus deux enfans un fils et une fille je les ai rendus fort heureux dans leur enfance j ai soigné leurs plaisirs je leur ai donné tous les maîtres qui avoient le plus de réputation et j ai joui de leur tendresse jusqu à ce que l un eût atteint dix huit ans et l autre seize c est vers cette époque que commence la nouvelle perspective de ma vie celle qui se rembrunissant de plus en plus s est enfin terminée par le genre de vie que je mène ici et qui ressemble autant qu il se peut à la mort",
		"o dieu",
		"une femme qui s intéresse à m d orsan tendit les bras involontairement comme pour arrêter madame de tesin elle ne s en aperçut seulement pas et prenant m d orsan à part elle lui parla bas avec une grande activité",
		"quand je regrettais l amour et désirois le succès la société la nature tout me paroissoit mal combiné parce que je n avois deviné le secret de rien je me sentois hors de l ordre à l extrémité du cercle de l existence mais rentrée dans la morale je suis au centre de la vie et loin d être agitée par le mouvement universel je le vois tourner autour de moi sans qu il puisse m atteindre",
		"depuis que je ne vous vois plus je me sens dégradé je ne fais plus rien de moi même je compare en frémissant la douleur qui m attend à celle que j ai déjà sentie j essaie de recourir à des distractions impuissantes et je me dis souvent qu il vaudroit mieux se donner la mort qu être occupé sans cesse à fuir la vie",
		"j ai peur d être déchiré par deux puissances égales un coeur sensible et passionné un caractère fier et irritable",
		"conservez avec elle la supériorité qui vous convient",
		"non les affections du coeur me tuent",
		"madame vous ne répondez rien",
		"vous le voyez tout est dit",
		"madame de vernon a fait de moi ce qu elle a voulu non par l empire des affections mais en excitant tous les mouvemens amers que le ressentiment peut inspirer",
		"comment pourrai je la convaincre de mon innocence lorsque je dois surtout lui conseiller de ne pas imiter ma conduite",
		"p s il importe que madame d ervins ne sache pas que mon intention est de revenir en france",
		"si vous saviez dans quel état est mon âme mais puisque je me suis promis de me contraindre il faut en avoir la force même avec vous",
		"après trois heures d une immobilité stupide j ai retrouvé la force de vous écrire louise ma seule amie rappelez moi près de vous ils sont tous heureux ici qu ai je à faire dans ce pays de joie",
		"dérobez vous donc dans ce moment aux dangereux sentimens que vos charmes ont inspirés mais songez que vous devez un jour vous réunir à moi et qu il ne vous est pas permis de vous séparer de celle qui n a d autre intérêt dans ce monde que son attachement pour vous",
		"espérons que léonce si fier si irritable si généralement admiré aura cette bonté sans laquelle il faut redouter une âme forte et un esprit supérieur bien loin de désirer de s en rapprocher",

		"ma blessure m inquiète à présent il m arrive de craindre qu elle ne se rouvre des mouvemens si passionnés m agitent que j éprouve le croiriez vous la peur de mourir avant demain avant une heure avant l instant où je dois la revoir",
		"mais on a renoncé dans ce moment à ce projet et mon espoir s est évanoui du moins pour un temps je voulus interrompre léonce et lui exprimer l éloignement que j aurois pour une semblable proposition si elle étoit possible mais à l instant il me saisit la main avec une action très vive au nom du ciel ne prononcez pas un mot sur ce que je viens de vous dire",
		"ce n est point sans dessein que je vous ai demandé d assister à la plus douce époque de ma vie j espérois que les sentimens qu elle vous inspireroit vous détourneroient des cruelles résolutions que je vous vois prête à suivre et je me suis promis de vous exprimer avec sincérité toute la peine qu elles me font éprouver",
		"les tourmens n affranchissent ils pas des devoirs",
		"en me livrant mon amie à ces pensées tristes mais sensibles à ces pensées qui adoucissoient entièrement mon caractère puisqu elles m apprenoient à dédaigner ce qui m avoit si cruellement irrité j ouvris un livre anglois que vous m avez donné et les premiers vers qui frappèrent mes regards comme par un hasard secourable furent un portrait de femme qui semble être le vôtre et que je me plais à vous transcrire",
		"je crois qu elle a changé jusqu à mon caractère daignez m entendre vous jugerez mieux que moi même de ce coeur qui se confiant tout entier à vous attend votre approbation pour s estimer encore",
		"et vous léonce et vous continua t elle serez vous heureux si vous entraînez mon amie",
		"sans répondre donc à matilde elle s adressa à moi et me dit ma chère delphine ce sera vous qui m accompagnerez n est ce pas",
		"dont le seul nom émeut si profondément tous ceux qui dès leur enfance ont respiré ton air si doux et contemplé ton ciel serein",
		"je vous en conjure ajouta t il soyez tranquille pensez vous que dans un tel moment je voulusse vous compromettre encore",
		"m d ervins apprendra les torts de sa femme par de perfides plaisanteries et la blessure d amour propre qu il en recevra sera bien plus terrible",
		"si m de mondoville au milieu des événemens que prépare la révolution pouvoit un jour trouver comme moi le moyen de rompre une union si mal assortie mon mari seroit bien ardent à le lui conseiller mais à quoi servent nos inutiles voeux",
		"madame de r me reçut comme si je lui avois rendu la vie en effet c est la vie que le soulagement de ces douleurs que la société peut imposer quand elle exerce sans pitié toute sa puissance",

		"sa fille qui avoit passé la nuit à la veiller est montée chez moi ce matin elle m a dit que sa mère étoit plus mal que le jour précédent et qu il ne restoit plus aucun espoir il faut donc ajouta t elle il faut absolument que vous lui parliez de la nécessité d accomplir ses devoirs de religion je vous en conjure ayez ce courage il aura plus de mérite avec vos opinions qu avec les miennes et vous m éviterez le plus cruel des malheurs en sauvant ma pauvre mère de la perdition qui la menace",
		"je ne sais ce qui peut nous être réservé dans un autre monde mais l enfer de celui ci pour un homme qui a de la fierté c est d avoir à supporter la moindre altération de cette intacte renommée d honneur et de délicatesse le premier trésor de la vie",
		"m de valorbe reprit delphine avec plus de calme et retrouvant dans le désespoir même le courage et la dignité quand je vous estimois j ai refusé de m unir à vous quel espoir pouvez vous former maintenant vous me méprisez donc",
		"j étois déjà vivement intéressée lorsque le père de madame de cerlebe arriva",
		"matilde me conduisit enfin chez la pauvre malade la chambre étoit obscure à travers le jour sombre qui l éclairoit j aperçus madame de vernon couchée sur un canapé les cheveux détachés vêtue de blanc et d une pâleur effrayante",

		"il faut aussi prévenir madame de vernon et matilde",
		"j ai l honneur d être avec respect mademoiselle votre très humble et très obéissant serviteur télin négociant à bayonne",
		"mais la moralité de ce roman ne se borne point à l exemple de delphine j ai voulu montrer aussi ce qui peut être condamnable dans la rigueur que la société exerce contre elle et quoique je vienne de développer avec impartialité les motifs de cette rigueur je crois que dans les grandes villes surtout les jugemens que l on porte sur les actions et les caractères n ont pas pour base les véritables principes de la moralité",
		"a ce mot je sentis mon sang se glacer mais un mouvement presque aussi rapide succédant au premier j eus honte d avouer mon secret à madame de vernon dans le moment même où j allois m engager au don que j avois promis et je craignis de m exposer ainsi à ce qu il fût refusé",

		"j ai mérité ce que j éprouve jamais aucune confiance n a existé entre nous",
		"je n avois jamais pensé qu à la douleur d une mère lorsque je vis la mâle expression des regrets paternels ce jeune homme pleurant sur l enfance cette âme forte abattue je fus touché profondément les femmes sont destinées à verser des larmes mais quand les hommes en répandent je ne sais quelle corde habituellement silencieuse résonne tout à coup au fond du coeur",
		"peut être bien plus courte encore pour nous oui tu as raison répondit il en revenant j étois insensé de partir",
		"vous avez même voulu contenir devant moi l impression que vous receviez en apprenant quelle étoit sur ce sujet l opinion de presque tous les gentilshommes mais je crains que vous ne cédiez à l empire de cette opinion maintenant que vous êtes séparé de la céleste amie qui l auroit combattue",
		"il me fut impossible de rester plus longtemps à bellerive l inaction du corps quand l âme est agitée est un supplice que la nature ne peut supporter je montai en voiture j ordonnai qu on me conduisît à paris sans aucun projet sans aucune idée qu il me fût possible de m avouer je sentois encore non de l espérance mais quelque chose qui différoit cependant de l impression qu une nouvelle certaine fait éprouver",
		"eh bien",
		"je le vois encore ah",
		"la plupart des personnes qui composent cette société sont en général très indulgentes pour leur propre conduite et souvent même aussi pour celle des autres lorsqu elles n ont pas intérêt à la blâmer mais si par malheur il leur convient de saisir le côté sévère de la question elles ne tarissent plus sur les devoirs et les principes et vont beaucoup plus loin en rigueur que les femmes véritablement austères résolues à se diriger elles mêmes d après ce qu elles disent sur les autres",
		"je ne croyois plus que personne le fût sur la terre madame de lebensei touchée sans doute de mon attendrissement me dit avec un mouvement très aimable vous saurez madame puisque vous le désirez tout ce qui concerne mon sort je ne puis être insensible à l espoir de captiver votre estime",

		"alors les enfants seraient obligés de retourner à rome pour amasser la somme demandée par les brigands ils devaient feindre de ne pas trouver cette somme avec rapidité et les brigands suivant leur menace ne voyant point arriver l argent auraient mis à mort françois cenci",

		"rien d aimable ne nous reste de ce don juan son caractère ne fut point adouci et amoindri par l idée d être avant tout homme de bonne compagnie comme le don juan de molière",
		"quand monsignor guerra apprenait que le signor cenci était hors de son palais il montait à l appartement des dames et passait plusieurs heures à discourir avec elles et à écouter leurs plaintes des traitements incroyables auxquels toutes les deux étaient en butte",
		"ce mot rendit toute sa tranquillité à béatrix autant elle avait montré d extravagance et d emportement d abord autant elle fut sage et raisonnable dès que sa belle mère eut rappelé cette grande âme à elle même",
		"presque tous les étrangers qui arrivent à rome se font conduire dès le commencement de leur tournée à la galerie barberini ils sont appelés les femmes surtout par les portraits de béatrix cenci et de sa belle mère",
		"enfin par grâce spéciale il voulut bien accorder un sursis de vingt cinq jours",
		"il donnait à entendre à cette pauvre fille une hérésie effroyable que j ose à peine rapporter à savoir que lorsqu un père connaît sa propre fille les enfants qui naissent sont nécessairement des saints et que tous les plus grands saints vénérés par l église sont nés de cette façon c est à dire que leur grand père maternel a été leur père",
		"il se promenait avec elle dans les salles de son palais lui étant parfaitement nu puis il la conduisait dans le lit de sa femme afin qu à la lueur des lampes la pauvre lucrèce pût voir ce qu il faisait avec béatrix",
		"avec le temps il y donna les mains et vivement pressé à diverses reprises par béatrix il consentit enfin à communiquer cet étrange dessein à giacomo cenci sans le consentement duquel on ne pouvait rien faire puisqu il était le frère aîné et chef de la maison après françois",
		"c est là que je veux les mettre tous disait il souvent avec un rire amer aux ouvriers qu il employait à construire son église",
		"cette circonstance donna de grandes espérances à rome qui dans toute cette cause ne voyait que béatrix",
		"nous n avons que deux portraits du don juan d italie tel qu il dut se montrer en ce beau pays au seizième siècle au début de la civilisation renaissante",
		"la tête est douce et belle le regard très doux et les yeux fort grands ils ont l air étonné d une personne qui vient d être surprise au moment où elle pleurait à chaudes larmes",
		"il était fort connu sur toutes les routes des états de sa sainteté il payait généreusement mais aussi il était capable deux ou trois mois après une offense à lui faite d expédier un de ses sicaires pour tuer la personne qui l avait offensé",
		"alors on vit exécuter des malheureux pour des assassinats ou empoisonnements oubliés depuis dix ans mais dont ils avaient eu le malheur de se confesser au cardinal montalto depuis sixte quint",
		"cet homme qui l on ne peut le nier avait reçu du ciel une sagacité et une bizarrerie étonnantes fut fils de monsignor cenci lequel sous pie v ghislieri s était élevé au poste de trésorier ministre des finances",
		"ne sachant ce qu elle avait à faire elle demanda à alexandre premier bourreau comment elle devrait se comporter",
		"il n est pas étonnant que la peinture de don juan ait été introduite dans la littérature par un poète espagnol",
		"le commissaire royal fit arrêter tout ce qui habitait dans la forteresse",

		"cependant toutes les copies nécessaires de la sentence de mort ne purent être terminées qu à cinq heures du matin de façon que ce ne fut qu à six heures du matin que l on put aller annoncer la fatale nouvelle à ces pauvres malheureux qui dormaient tranquillement",
		"mais ce mouvement lui parut offensant pour la pudeur et elle mit beaucoup de temps à le faire",
		"c est qu à rome en personne n ignorait les faits",
		"comme il était prouvé dans le procès que plusieurs fois son père avait employé la force dans un dessein criminel les avocats espéraient que le meurtre lui serait pardonné à elle comme se trouvant dans le cas de légitime défense s il en était ainsi l auteur principal du crime obtenant la vie comment ses frères qui avaient été séduits par elle pouvaient ils être punis de mort",

		"la plus âgée quoique surveillée de près se donna tant de soins qu elle parvint à faire présenter une supplique au pape elle conjura sa sainteté de la marier ou de la placer dans un monastère",
		"il ne faut pas parler du don juan de lord byron ce n est qu un faublas un beau jeune homme insignifiant et sur lequel se précipitent toutes sortes de bonheurs invraisemblables",
		"françois cenci se sera dit par quelles actions parlantes moi romain né à rome en précisément pendant les six mois pendant lesquels les soldats luthériens du connétable de bourbon y commirent sur les choses saintes les plus affreuses profanations par quelles actions pourrais je faire remarquer mon courage et me donner le plus profondément possible le plaisir de braver l opinion",
		"toutes ces choses ne lui suffirent point il tenta avec des menaces et en employant la force de violer sa propre fille béatrix laquelle était déjà grande et belle il n eut pas honte d aller se placer dans son lit lui se trouvant dans un état complet de nudité",
		"arrivée à la porte de la prison la bannière s arrêta les deux femmes sortirent firent leur adoration au pied du saint crucifix et ensuite s acheminèrent à pied l une à la suite de l autre",
		"le moindre vice qui fût à reprendre en françois cenci ce fut la propension à un amour infâme le plus grand fut celui de ne pas croire en dieu",
		"françois cenci eut connaissance de cette tentative et l on peut juger avec quelle colère il redoubla de mauvais traitements envers ces deux malheureuses femmes",
		"comment est ce possible ah",
		"animés par ce peu de paroles fulminantes et craignant quelque diminution dans le prix convenu les assassins rentrèrent résolument dans la chambre et furent suivis par les femmes",
		"la pitié nous a empêchés d agir",
		"on donna une sépulture honorable à françois cenci et les femmes revinrent à rome jouir de cette tranquillité qu elles avaient désirée en vain depuis si longtemps",
		"s écriait elle qu ainsi à l improviste je doive mourir",
		"pour que le don juan soit possible il faut qu il y ait de l hypocrisie dans le monde",
		"il était avéré qu elle avait aimé monsignor guerra mais n avait jamais transgressé les règles de la vertu la plus sévère on ne pouvait donc en véritable justice lui imputer les crimes d un monstre et on la punirait parce qu elle avait usé du droit de se défendre",
		"on commença à parler sous ce dernier pape du jeune françois cenci à cause de certains amours singuliers amenés à bonne réussite par des moyens plus singuliers encore",
		"béatrix fut gardée dans le palais de son père par une grosse troupe de sbires",
		"en apprenant le sort de son fils christophe il s écria qu il ne pourrait goûter quelque joie que lorsque tous ses enfants seraient enterrés et que lorsque le dernier viendrait à mourir il voulait en signe de bonheur mettre le feu à son palais",
		"on le fit revenir avec de l eau fraîche et on le plaça vis à vis la mannaja",
		"ce fut principalement sous grégoire xiii que l on commençât à beaucoup parler de françois cenci il avait épousé une femme fort riche et telle qu il convenait à un seigneur si accrédité elle mourut après lui avoir donné sept enfants",
		"lucrèce petroni au contraire ne dit rien que de fort convenable d abord elle pria à genoux puis exhorta tranquillement sa fille à venir avec elle à la chapelle où elles devaient toutes deux se préparer à ce grand passage de la vie à la mort",
		"le voile de la jeune fille était de taffetas bleu comme sa robe elle avait de plus un grand voile de drap d argent sur les épaules une jupe de drap violet et des mules de velours blanc lacées avec élégance et retenues par des cordons cramoisis",
		"il lui dit de se placer à cheval sur la planche du cep",
		"jamais le juge ne put l induire à une réponse qui la compromît le moins du monde et bien plus par sa vivacité pleine d esprit elle confondit complètement ce célèbre ulysse moscati juge chargé de l interroger",
		"la vie leur devint absolument insupportable et ce fut alors que voyant bien qu elles n avaient rien à espérer de la justice du souverain dont les courtisans étaient gagnés par les riches cadeaux de françois elles eurent l idée d en venir au parti extrême qui les a perdues mais qui pourtant a eu cet avantage de terminer leurs souffrances en ce monde",
		"ce portrait sur l authenticité duquel il ne peut s élever aucun doute car on trouve des copies contemporaines est tout différent de la figure qui à la galerie de florence est donnée comme le portrait de la maîtresse de raphaël et a été gravé sous ce nom par morghen",
		"que c est une bassesse et une honte répondirent ils de tuer un pauvre vieillard endormi",
		"ce mémorial parlait aussi au nom de lucrèce belle mère de béatrix",
		"le don juan n a jamais de plaisir par les sympathies par les douces rêveries ou les illusions d un coeur tendre",
		"se moquer du juge n est ce pas le premier pas le premier essai de tout petit don juan qui débute",
		"mais lucrèce fut arrêtée par le respect dû à une fête de la madone et elle engagea béatrix à différer d un jour afin de ne pas commettre un double pêché",
		"le gouvernement seul parlait de s abstenir il défendait les choses qui pouvaient nuire à la patrie c est à dire à l intérêt bien entendu de tous et non ce qui peut nuire à l individu qui agit",
		"l affaire se traita avec toutes les formes convenables et l on prit sur toutes choses le vote de la belle mère et de la jeune fille",
		"de là elles jetèrent le corps sur un grand sureau qui croissait en ce lieu solitaire",
		"la seule action vertueuse qu il ait faite pendant toute sa longue vie a été de bâtir dans la cour de son vaste palais près du tibre une église dédiée à saint thomas et encore il fut poussé à cette belle action par le désir singulier d avoir sous ses yeux les tombeaux de tous ses enfants pour lesquels il eut une haine excessive et contre nature même dès leur plus tendre jeunesse quand ils ne pouvaient encore l avoir offensé en rien",
		"nous commencions à espérer qu un peu honteux de la boutade qui lui avait fait interrompre le plaidoyer des avocats il pardonnerait à qui avait repoussé la force par la force non pas à la vérité au moment du premier crime mais lorsqu on tentait de le commettre de nouveau",
		"elles restèrent là jusqu à quatre heures et un quart après midi",
		"sa femme et sa malheureuse fille furent suivant toute apparence victime de ses idées abominables",
		"comment étonnerais je mes sots contemporains",
		"c est en italie et au dix septième siècle qu une princesse disait en prenant une glace avec délices le soir d une journée fort chaude quel dommage que ce ne soit pas un pêché",
		"cenci arriva sans encombre à la petrella les brigands las d attendre une proie douteuse allèrent voler ailleurs pour leur propre compte",
		"tous regardaient les deux frères lorqu à l improviste s avança le fiscal de rome qui dit signor bernardo notre seigneur vous fait grâce de la vie soumettez vous à accompagner vos parents et priez dieu pour eux",
		"pendant la nuit tandis que son père dormait elle leur parla d une fenêtre basse et leur jeta des lettres qui étaient adressées à monsignor guerra",
		"mais le jour suivant ils furent séparés de nouveau les deux frères furent conduits à la prison de tordinona et les femmes restèrent à la prison savella",
		"le second portrait précieux de la galerie barberini est du guide c est le portrait de béatrix cenci dont on voit tant de mauvaises gravures",
		"il rencontra plusieurs troupes de sbires qui n eurent garde de l arrêter",
		"bientôt après à l occasion de ses amours infâmes françois fut mis en prison pour la troisième et dernière fois sur quoi les trois frères sollicitèrent une audience de notre saint père actuellement régnant et le prièrent en commun de faire mourir françois cenci leur père qui dirent ils déshonorait leur maison",
		"et sa mauvaise humeur augmentant avec les infirmités de l âge qui lui étaient insupportables il redoublait les traitements atroces qu il faisait subir aux deux pauvres femmes",
		"sur quoi un auteur napolitain s écrie n est ce rien que de braver le ciel et de croire qu au moment même le ciel peut vous réduire en cendre",
		"a ce coup imprévu françois cenci montra une extrême colère et pour empêcher que béatrix en devenant plus grande n eût l idée de suivre l exemple de sa soeur il la séquestra dans un des appartements de son immense palais",
		"en j eus le bonheur de voir l italie avec des êtres aimables et que je n oublierai jamais je fus séduit comme eux par l admirable portrait de béatrix cenci que l on voit à rome au palais barberini",
		"les deux frères mis à la torture furent bien loin d imiter la grandeur d âme du brigand marzio ils eurent la pusillanimité de tout avouer",
		"le vingt cinquième jour ils parurent tous ensemble devant sa sainteté",
		"après la mort de cet homme le corps du délit n étant point prouvé les juges ne trouvèrent pas qu il y eût raison suffisante pour mettre à la torture soit les deux fils de cenci soit les deux femmes",
		"notre saint père le pape ayant vu l acte authentique contenant les aveux de tous ordonna que sans délai ils fussent attachés à la queue de chevaux indomptés et ainsi mis à mort",
		"de ces deux portraits il en est un que je ne puis absolument faire connaître le siècle est trop collet monté il faut se rappeler ce grand mot que j ai ouï répéter bien des fois à lord byron this age of cant",
		"pendant qu elle était attachée à la corde ce nouveau juge fit paraître devant béatrix sa belle mère et ses frères",
		"histoire veritable de la mort de jacques et béatrix cenci et de lucrèce petroni cenci leur belle mère exécutés pour crime de parricide samedi dernier septembre sous le règne de notre saint père le pape clément viii aldobrandini",
		"elle avait la bouche petite les cheveux blonds et naturellement bouclés",
		"ces malheureux furent forcés d avoir recours au pape qui força françois cenci à leur faire une petite pension",
		"je ne pense par que le don juan athénien pût arriver jusqu au crime aussi rapidement que le don juan des monarchies modernes une grande partie du plaisir de celui ci consiste à braver l opinion et il a débuté dans sa jeunesse par s imaginer qu il bravait seulement l hypocrisie",
		"bien des années après l an farinacci en envoyant ses plaidoyers à l impression ajouta une note à celui qu il avait prononcé en faveur des cenci omnes fuerunt ultimo supplicio effecti excepto bernardo qui ad triremes cum bonorum confiscatione condemnatus fuit ac etiam ad interessendum aliorum morti prout interfuit",
		"j ai acheté la permission de copier un récit contemporain j ai cru pouvoir en donner la traduction sans blesser aucune convenance du moins cette traduction put elle être lue tout haut devant des dames en",
		"deux cent mille piastres font à peu près cinq millions de",
		"le troisième portrait de la galerie barberini est celui de lucrèce petroni belle mère de béatrix qui fut exécutée avec elle",
		"là personne n eut la permission de voir béatrix alors à peine âgée de quatorze ans et déjà dans tout l éclat d une ravissante beauté",
		"afin qu elle puisse aussi conserver quelque souvenir de ses malheurs sans pareils et de la force étonnante avec laquelle cette âme vraiment romaine sut les combattre j ai résolu d écrire ce que j ai appris sur l action qui l a conduite à la mort et ce que j ai vu le jour de sa glorieuse tragédie",
		"malheureusement les demi teintes ont poussé au rouge de brique pendant ce long intervalle de deux cent trente huit ans qui nous sépare de la catastrophe dont on va lire le récit",
		"ainsi les ombres des cenci s en allèrent bien accompagnées",
		"ce sentiment forme suivant moi la base du caractère du don juan et comme on voit la religion chrétienne lui est nécessaire",
		"pendant que les cardinaux les plus puissants faisaient tant de pas inutiles farinacci notre grand jurisconsulte a bien eu l audace de pénétrer jusqu au pape arrivé devant sa sainteté cet homme étonnant a eu l adresse d intéresser sa conscience et enfin il a arraché à force d importunités la vie de bernard cenci",
		"elle a demandé un notaire pour faire son testament ce qui lui a été accordé",
		"les manches de leurs robes étaient fort larges de façon qu on voyait leurs bras qui étaient couverts d une chemise serrée aux poignets comme c est l usage en ce pays",
		"vous êtes dans une grande erreur mais puisque vous le voulez qu il en soit ainsi",
		"son désavantage est de raccourcir infiniment le domaine de l histoire",
		"tous restaient muets lorsque farinacci osa élever la voix",
		"elle parut sur la place accompagnée par la bannière la tête enveloppée dans le voile de taffetas noir là elle fit sa réconciliation avec dieu et elle baisa les saintes plaies",
		"giacomo cenci sortit le premier de la prison il se mit à genoux dévotement sur le seuil de la porte fit sa prière et baisa les saintes plaies du crucifix",
		"stendhal les cenci chroniques italiennes le don juan de molière est galant sans doute mais avant tout il est homme de bonne compagnie avant de se livrer au penchant irrésistible qui l entraîne vers les jolies femmes il tient à se conformer à un certain modèle idéal il veut être l homme qui serait souverainement admiré à la cour d un jeune roi galant et spirituel",
		"par la rapidité de ses mouvements elle évita qu au moment où son voile de taffetas lui fût ôté le public aperçût ses épaules et sa poitrine",
		"comme il y avait des lieux à l extrémité de cette petite galerie elles espérèrent que lorsque le lendemain on trouverait le corps du vieillard tombé dans les branches du sureau on supposerait que le pied lui avait glissé et qu il était tombé en allant aux lieux",
		"tout semblait terminé et personne ne doutait plus dans rome que cette jeune fille si belle si courageuse et qui avait inspiré un si vif intérêt ne fût bientôt mise en liberté lorsque par malheur la justice vint à arrêter le brigand qui à terni avait tué olimpio conduit à rome cet homme avoua tout",
		"pendant cette tragédie la foule fut innombrable aussi loin que le regard pouvait s étendre on voyait les rues remplies de carrosses et de peuple les échafaudages les fenêtres et les toits remplis de curieux",
		"on fit entrer de cette même façon un autre grand clou dans la gorge de façon que cette pauvre âme chargée de tant de pêchés récents fut enlevée par les diables le corps se débattit mais en vain",
		"elle avait de fort beaux traits le nez petit les yeux noirs le visage très blanc avec de belles couleurs elle avait peu de cheveux et ils étaient châtains",
		"la chose faite la jeune donna à olimpio une grosse bourse remplie d argent elle donna à marzio un manteau de drap garni d un galon d or qui avait appartenu à son père et elle les renvoya",
		"a l instant ses deux confortatori lui ôtèrent la petite planche qui était devant ses yeux",
		"mais avant d aller à la messe la signora béatrix considéra qu il n était pas convenable de paraître sur l échafaud aux yeux de tout le peuple avec les riches habillements qu elles portaient",
		"tout à coup elles virent revenir ces deux hommes avec des figures pâles et comme hors d eux mêmes",
		"sur les treize heures à huit heures du matin la compagnie de la miséricorde apporta son grand crucifix à la porte de la prison",
		"la vanité",
		"mais la jeune béatrix avait le courage de la pudeur offensée et non la prudence nécessaire dans la vie dès le grand matin elle avait donné à une femme qui blanchissait le linge dans la forteresse un drap taché de sang parce que toute la nuit elle avait souffert d un grande perte de façon que pour le moment tout se passa bien",
		"mais cet homme admirable à qui la destinée avait donné de savoir bien faire toutes choses parvint à se sauver d une façon qui tient du miracle",
		"il fut convenu de plus que la chose aurait lieu le jour de la nativité de la vierge et à cet effet ces deux hommes furent introduits avec adresse dans la forteresse",
		"le soleil était d une telle ardeur ce jour là que beaucoup de gens perdirent connaissance",
		"bernard cenci ressemblait tout à fait à sa soeur et comme il portait les cheveux longs comme elle beaucoup de gens lorsqu il parut sur l échafaud le prirent pour elle",
		"les femmes restées seules commencèrent par retirer ce grand clou enfoncé dans la tête du cadavre et celui qui était dans le cou ensuite ayant enveloppé le corps dans un drap de lit elles le traînèrent à travers une longue suite de chambres jusqu à une galerie qui donnait sur un petit jardin abandonné",
		"on lui répondit que oui elle se jeta à genoux devant le crucifix et pria avec ferveur pour son âme",
		"au moyen de ces lettres il fut convenu que monsignor guerra promettrait à marzio et olimpio mille piastres s ils voulaient se charger eux mêmes de mettre à mort françois cenci",
		"la justice napolitaine avait fait arrêter marzio qui fut conduit à naples où sur le champ il avoua toutes choses",
		"avec ce secours fort médiocre ils se séparèrent de lui",
		"le portrait de florence n est pas même de raphaël",
		"de sa vie on ne le vit entrer dans une église",
		"il voyageait toujours seul et sans prévenir personne quand son premier cheval était fatigué il en achetait ou en volait un autre",
		"mais il n en fut pas de même de béatrix cenci jeune fille pleine de vivacité et de courage",
		"parmi nous les femmes ne sont plus à la mode c est pourquoi les don juan sont rares mais quand il y en avait ils commençaient toujours par chercher des plaisirs fort naturels tout en se faisant gloire de braver ce qui leur semblait des idées non fondées en raison dans la religion de leurs contemporains",
		"le don juan eût été un effet sans cause de l antiquité la religion était une fête elle exhortait les hommes au plaisir comment aurait elle flétri des êtres qui faisaient d un certain plaisir leur unique affaire",
		"et c est pour en finir ainsi que vous osez prendre de l argent",
		"le soleil avait été si ardent que plusieurs des spectateurs de cette tragédie moururent dans la nuit et parmi eux ubaldino ubaldini jeune homme d une rare beauté et qui jouissait auparavant d une parfaite santé",
		"elle avait surtout une gaieté une candeur et un esprit comique que je n ai jamais vus qu à elle",
		"le pauvre bernard cenci qui était toujours resté assis sur l échafaud tomba de nouveau évanoui et il fallut plus d une grosse demi heure à ses confortatori pour le ranimer",
		"si on a ce crédit on sera tout étonné je pense en lisant ces pièces où tout est latin excepté les réponses des accusés de ne trouver presque pas l explication des faits",
		"peu après sa mort il prit en secondes noces lucrèce petroni d une rare beauté et célèbre surtout par l éclatante blancheur de son teint mais un peu trop replète comme c est le défaut commun de nos romaines",
		"la confession de l assassin de terni et cette fuite de monsignor guerra qui produisit une sensation étonnante dans rome ranimèrent tellement les soupçons et même les indices contre les cenci qu ils furent extraits du château saint ange et ramenés à la prison savella",
		"la signora lucrèce en sa qualité de veuve portait un voile noir et des mules de velours noir sans talons selon l usage",
		"rome fut étonnée de ce propos mais elle croyait tout possible d un pareil homme qui mettait sa gloire à braver tout le monde et le pape lui même",
		"la foule était énorme et il y eut du tumulte à cause d un vase qui tomba d une fenêtre presque sur la tête d un des pénitents qui tenait une torche allumée à côté de la bannière",
		"ainsi la religion comme le pouvoir absolu tempéré par les chansons qu on appelle la monarchie française a produit des choses singulières et curieuses que le monde n eût jamais vues peut être s il eût été privé de ces deux institutions",
		"et vous mes frères priez pour mon âme",
		"giacomo cenci était de petite taille gros le visage blanc et la barbe noire il avait vingt six ans à peu près quand il mourut",
		"aussitôt que giacomo et la signora lucrèce la virent le péché est commis lui crièrent ils il faut faire aussi la pénitence et ne pas se laisser déchirer le corps par une vaine obstination",
		"le jeune bernard recouvert de son manteau galonné fut conduit directement sur l échafaud alors tous crurent qu on allait le faire mourir et qu il n avait pas sa grâce",
		"je l ai vu dans ma jeunesse sous le pape buoncompagni aller à cheval de rome à naples sans doute pour quelqu une de ses amourettes il passait dans les bois de san germano et de la fajola sans avoir nul souci des brigands et faisait dit on la route en moins de vingt heures",
		"c est sans doute cette religion qui enseigna au monde qu un pauvre esclave qu un gladiateur avait une âme absolument égale en faculté à celle de césar lui même ainsi il faut la remercier de l apparition de sentiments délicats je ne doute pas au reste que tôt ou tard ces sentiments ne se fussent fait jour dans le sein des peuples",
		"violer les lois dans la monarchie à la louis xv tirer un coup de fusil à un couvreur et le faire dégringoler du haut de son toit n est ce pas une preuve que l on vit dans la société du prince que l on est du meilleur ton et que l on se moque fort du juge",
		"son grand plaisir était surtout de braver ses ennemis",
		"en entendant cette excuse béatrix fut saisie d indignation et commença à les injurier disant donc vous autres hommes bien préparés à une telle action vous n avez pas le courage de tuer un homme qui dort",
		"pendant qu on mettait en ordre la mannaja pour la jeune fille un échafaud chargé de curieux tomba et beaucoup de gens furent tués",
		"jacques cenci fut assommé mazzolato",
		"les traits sont grands et la carnation d une éclatante blancheur les sourcils noirs et fort marqués le regard est impérieux et en même temps chargé de volupté",
		"pendant ce temps elle invoquait à haute voix le nom de jésus christ et de la très sainte vierge",
		"monsignor guerra si étrangement compromis par l aveu du brigand fut cité à comparaître sous le moindre délai la prison était certaine et probablement la mort",
		"comme ils s en allaient l altieri marchait le dernier il eut peur de s être compromis et alla se mettre à genoux devant le pape disant je ne pouvais pas faire moins que de paraître dans cette cause étant avocat des pauvres",
		"quelques marchands ou négociants sauniers dont les chevaux ou les charrettes fréquentent la route de kertsch à pérékop tels sont les principaux chalands de l auberge d arabat gens peu difficiles sachant coucher à la dure et manger ce qui se rencontre",
		"quand",
		"et comment ne pas faire fortune dans une ville où tout le monde fume du matin au soir et même du soir au matin",
		"mais il me semble que voilà un café dit il",
		"et sur un signe tous le suivirent",
		"figure assez belle avec des yeux qui ne s animaient qu au feu de la passion front d un ton mat barbe noire dont les volutes s étageaient jusqu à mi poitrine bouche ornée de dents très blanches lèvres qui ne savaient pas sourire en somme la physionomie d un homme impérieux puissant par sa situation et sa fortune habitué à la réalisation de tous ses désirs à l accomplissement de toutes ses volontés et que la résistance eût poussé aux plus grands excès",
		"voilà toute une bande de sangliers sauvages il n y avait pas à s y tromper",
		"v où le seigneur kéraban discute à sa façon la manière dont il entend les voyages et quitte constantinople",
		"le pire à coup sûr répondait van mitten pour couper court à une discussion qu il sentait poindre",
		"leur voix avait lentement retenti au dessus de la ville appelant les fidèles à la prière et lançant dans l espace cette formule consacrée la ilah il allah vé mohammed reçoul allah il n y a de dieu que dieu et mahomet est le prophète de dieu",
		"il devait donc à son maître avec cette honorable bonne mine les cent soixante sept livres qu il pesait maintenant ce qui mettrait dans la bonne moyenne de ses compatriotes",
		"céder à cet homme contre lequel il avait tant pesté déjà",
		"on se dédommagera gaiement pendant toute la nuit des abstinences de la journée",
		"non de constantinople",
		"eh",
		"dit enfin le seigneur kéraban et je ne sais rien de mieux pour passer une heure que cette causerie intime avec son narghilé",
		"ma lettre dit kéraban au moment où le bruyant équipage allait quitter le comptoir",
		"c est convenu",
		"de là une perte assez sensible que le rancunier kéraban porta in petto au passif du seigneur saffar",
		"cela vous fera vingt paras par jour répondit le chef de police",
		"vous m accompagnerez vous dis je",
		"en effet mon cher ahmet de la part d un négociant aussi régulier dans ses affaires que votre oncle kéraban cela a lieu d étonner",
		"ton mariage amasia",
		"convenait il dès à présent de le préparer à cette grave éventualité",
		"et cependant s il était ici s il arrivait aujourd hui même demain au plus tard nous irions faire enregistrer le contrat chez le juge et après demain une fois la prière dite par l imam nous serions mariés et bien mariés et les fêtes se prolongeraient pendant quinze jours à la villa et le seigneur kéraban repartirait avant la fin si cela lui faisait plaisir de s en retourner là bas il est certain que les choses pourraient se passer ainsi à la condition que l oncle kéraban ne tarderait pas davantage à quitter constantinople",
		"dit le seigneur kéraban en faisant un petit signe à bruno qui crut devoir s incliner à la turque et ramener ses bras à son chapeau comme les deux anses d une amphore",
		"si le hollandais espérait voir si peu que ce fût des phénomènes naturels signalés par le postillon il se trompait mais quant à ces sifflements singuliers qui emplissaient parfois l air d une rumeur assourdissante il eût été difficile de ne pas les entendre à moins d être sourd",
		"as tu vu ce jeune homme yarhud pendant le temps qui s est écoulé entre ton arrivée à odessa et ton départ",
		"eh bien ça n est pas bon certes",
		"quant aux enfants ils vont presque nus et l hiver pour se réchauffer ils se blottissent dans l âtre de la kibitka et dorment sous la cendre chaude",
		"et ce saphir d ormuz et ces perles d ophir et ces turquoises de macédoine",
		"mais ces coupures sont comblées maintenant",
		"murmura bruno",
		"tout à coup une vive lueur se produisit sur le côté gauche de la route",
		"il l entraîna à demi suffoqué par les émanations de l hydrogène",
		"vous voyez donc bien que je n ai pas un instant à perdre",
		"en effet mon oncle",
		"il passera sans payer",
		"en sortant par la porte d iéni la chaise prit la route de constantinople à choumla d où se détache un embranchement sur andrinople par kirk kilissé",
		"vraiment",
		"le lendemain septembre à dix huit lieues de taman la chaise après avoir contourné la baie de kisiltasch traversait la bourgade d anapa et le soir vers huit heures elle s arrêtait à la bourgade de rajewskaja sur la limite de la région caucasienne",
		"une ceinture en cachemire lui retenait les pointes de la traîne de manière à faciliter sa marche",
		"amasia revint s accouder sur la balustrade",
		"mais enfin tous avaient échappé au péril l oncle et le neveu un peu roussis sans doute leurs compagnons sans même avoir eu la plus légère brûlure",
		"eh bien ami kéraban reprit le hollandais du ton dont il eût conté les aventures d un autre depuis quelques années la vie était devenue intolérable entre madame van mitten et moi",
		"cette arrivée c était la célébration du mariage à bref délai",
		"une lettre",
		"une lettre du seigneur kéraban où le seigneur kéraban répétera suivant son habitude que ses affaires le retiennent à constantinople qu il ne peut encore quitter son comptoir que les tabacs sont en hausse à moins qu ils ne soient en baisse qu il arrivera dans huit jours sans faute à moins que ce ne soit dans quinze",
		"aussi l attelage put il enlever d un trait les quatres verstes qui séparent la pointe de la bourgade de taman",
		"en somme c était la steppe russe dans toute sa nudité",
		"ils couraient sur les côtés s attaquant les uns aux chevaux les autres à la voiture qui ne parvenait pas à les distancer",
		"il faut dire en outre que les chevaux guidés par leur instinct s étaient maintenus sur cette portion de la steppe qu ils avaient l habitude de parcourir",
		"ils étaient tous partis",
		"je n ai pas dit qu il se ferait scarpante répondit yarhud j ai dit qu il devait se faire",
		"que vous ne le pourriez pas en ce moment scarpante et le capitaine maltais qui se promenaient au fond de la place s approchèrent",
		"le capitaine maltais le savait bien",
		"son canot l attendait au bas des degrés ses matelots étaient gens à lui obéir sur un signe il n avait qu à vouloir",
		"là se dessinait ce littoral dont les voyageurs allaient obstinément suivre le contour là cette route où les retards les dangers peut être mettraient à l épreuve le soigneur kéraban et tous ceux qu il entraînait malgré eux",
		"sur les routes ordinaires on trouve des relais de poste et rien n empêche de voyager à cheval avec ses provisions son campement sa cantine sous la conduite d un guide à moins qu on ne se mette à la suite du tatar c est à dire du courrier chargé du service postal mais comme ce courrier ne doit employer qu un temps limité pour aller d un point à un autre le suivre est très fatigant pour ne pas dire impraticable à qui n a pas l habitude de ces longues traites",
		"non nedjeb répondit amasia",
		"mais c est le ramadan van mitten",
		"non",
		"avec des chevaux de relais",
		"si vous étiez a ma place vous ne seriez pas si patiente",
		"sans doute",
		"ce serait bien joué à mon avis répondit van mitten",
		"la presqu île de kertsch est divisée par une longue tranchée faite aux temps antiques qu on appelle le rempart d akos",
		"le fourneau des narghilés fut aussitôt empli de tabac mais il va sans dire que si le seigneur kéraban fit bourrer le sien de tombéki d origine persane suivant son invariable coutume van mitten s en tint à son ordinaire qui était du latakié de l asie mineure",
		"répondit ahmet avec un accent de conviction qui alla jusqu au coeur de son oncle",
		"revoir encore une fois",
		"yarhud s était penché à l oreille de scarpante six semaines",
		"un instant mon jeune ami reprit le hollandais et permettez moi de vous adresser une question",
		"tous ces bijoux lui parlaient d ahmet et à travers l incessant babil de nedjeb ses yeux allant de l un à l autre lui répondaient en silence",
		"ahmet comptait amener la chaise toute attelée à l auberge de manière que son oncle et van mitten n eussent plus qu à y monter pour suivre le chemin de la presqu île de kertsch",
		"il n y a donc pas un instant à perdre",
		"cependant la chaise avait descendu les pentes qui aboutissent à iénikalé faisant partir d assourdissantes volées d outardes remisées dans les grandes herbes",
		"aussi reprit kéraban le gouvernement turc a t il été fort mal avisé comme toujours en frappant le tabac d un impôt qui en a décuplé le prix",
		"s écria kéraban en serrant avec une vigueur qui touchait à la violence la main de son correspondant de rotterdam",
		"il y avait un dindon rôti un de ces gâteaux de farine de maïs piqués de languettes d un fromage de buffle qui portent le nom de gatschapouri l inévitable plat national le blini sorte de crêpe au lait acide puis pour boisson quelques bouteilles d une bière épaisse et des flacons de vadka eau de vie très forte dont les russes font une incroyable consommation",
		"cependant à défaut de railways peut être y aurait il un moyen très simple de nous rendre à scutari sans franchir le bosphore mais aussi sans faire le tour de la mer noire",
		"au point de vue administratif la turquie d europe est divisée en vilayets gouvernements ou départements administrés par un vali gouverneur général sorte de préfet nommé par le sultan",
		"répondit bruno",
		"nous ne voulons pas vous contrarier mais il nous semble que pour aller directement de constantinople à scutari il n y a qu à traverser le bosphore",
		"on se rappelle en effet ce qui s était passé lorsque l itinéraire fut modifié à kherson",
		"le mariage fait amasia est la femme d ahmet répondit scarpante et ce n est pas la femme d ahmet que le seigneur saffar compte trouver à trébizonde",
		"mais il était bien décidé à ne point épargner la bourse de son oncle dans tous les cas où un retard devrait être évité ou un obstacle franchi à prix d argent",
		"ah",
		"ami kéraban dit van mitten dans la louable intention de faire entendre raison au plus intraitable des hommes",

		"gegen uns über erschien die gegend ernster",
		"herr bist du es so heiße mich zu dir kommen auf dem wasser",
		"nun ward es lichter in den zweigen und der wald endete sich gegen den rand des berges der sich in das einsame lahntal senkte hier küßte mich die mutter und ließ mich an die erde",
		"ach das waren wohl harte und wahre worte meines mänteleins und ich nahm es mit schämen von dem fenster und legte es um über meinen neuen staat und faßte es fest mit den händen um die brust als wollte ich es um verzeihung bitten und ging mit dem gedanken die treppe hinab in den garten wenn ich ein armer fahrender schüler gewesen bin so werde ich immer ein armer fahrender schüler bleiben denn auf erden sind wir alle arm und müssen mannigfach mit unserm leben herumwandeln und lernen und bleiben doch arme schüler bis der herr sich unser erbarmet und uns einführet durch seinen bittern tod in das ewige leben",
		"da hob ich an chronika des fahrenden schülers johannes laurenburger von polsnich an der lahn dieses buch ist mir wert und lieb wer es mir stiehlt der ist ein dieb",
		"das lahntal schließt von diesem punkte gesehen den spiegel des flusses mit einer krümme wie einen tiefliegenden see ein und die berge lagen mit dunklem walde bedeckt streng und finster um diesen her als hätten sie tiefsinnige gedanken über ein leid das hier geschehen",
		"alles menschenwerk so es die gewöhnlichen grenzen an größe oder vollendung überschreitet hat etwas erschreckendes an sich und man muß lange dabei verweilen ehe man es mit ruhe und trost genießen kann",
		"sie sprach nicht sie flüsterte betend und so entschlief ich bald aber weckten mich laute worte von ihr und ich hörte sie sagen hüter ist die nacht schier hin",
		"ich habe dieses aber nicht allein bei dem anblick dieses schwindelhohen turmes empfunden sondern auch bei gar lieblichen und feinen werken von welchen ich nur nennen will die überaus feinen und natürlichen gemälde des malers wilhelm in köln der von den meistern als der beste meister in allen deutschen landen geachtet wird denn er malet einen jeglichen menschen von aller gestalt als lebe er",
		"ich habe aber damals die sonne zum ersten male aufgehen sehen weil ich so früh vorher nie aufgestanden",
		"da gab er mir die hand und wir schieden",
		"da nahm die mutter die linnen und gaben wir sie unten dem bruder schneider der hielt aber der mutter den korb zurück bis wir aus der kirche kamen",
		"in solchen betrachtungen wollte ich wieder nach dem sommerhäuslein gehn sah aber meinen gnädigen herrn und ritter gar tiefsinnig mit gefalteten händen unter einem baume im sonnenschein sitzen und traute nicht ihm vorüberzugehen damit ich ihn nicht störe",
		"dann hob er an und sprach du hast recht lieber johannes du warst recht reich eine so liebe mutter auf erden zu finden das ist ein schönes lied aber es ist auch viel trauer darin wer hat es denn also gesetzet daß es am ende so schmerzlich vom scheiden spricht",
		"aber meine hoffart währte nicht lange denn mein zerrissenes mäntelein welches ich als einen vorhang vor das fenster gehängt hatte erleuchtete sich durch die aufgehende sonne und alle seine löcher waren so viele mäuler und alle seine fetzen so viele zungen die mich meiner törichten hoffart zeihten",
		"lies nun",
		"wer da",
		"und weinte laut",
		"sie sang aber ein lied das lautete also es sang vor langen jahren wohl auch die nachtigall das war wohl süßer schall da wir zusammen waren",
		"was mag trauriger sein als das bild eines bettlers auf goldnem grunde gemalet",
		"da sagte mir meine mutter ins ohr bete hübsch fromm johannes der stehende alte ritter ist der alte laurenburger dein großvater bete hübsch für ihn",
		"da sprach ich du sollst vater und mutter lieben auf daß du lang lebest auf erden du sollst deinen nächsten lieben wie dich selbst und gott über alles",
		"damit ihr euer alter vergesset bei mir will ich euch erfreuen mit mancherlei fröhlichen reden und gedanken",
		"sie sagte mir die gebete vor ich schaute nach ihren lippen und sprach ihr nach und ich erinnere mich noch recht sehr deutlich meiner großen freude als ich zum ersten male abends neben ihr an ihrem betschemel kniete und diese heiligen gebete mit ihr fertig und ohne fehl sprach",
		"da ließ ich die augen fröhlich in der kammer umherschweifen und sah auf dem schemel ein neues gewand liegen das mir mein gütiger herr und ritter veltlin von türlingen am abend im dunkeln hatte herauftragen lassen und konnte ich meine begierde nun nicht länger zurückhalten sprang auf von meinem lager und legte diese kleider nicht ohne tränen des dankes an",
		"wie fühlte ich mich in meiner ungebärdigkeit beschämt",
		"sie aber antwortete ich werde nicht wiederkehren doch werdet ihr mir nachfolgen und da wird alles voll herrlichkeit sein aber hörst du elslein du mußt mir den abschied nicht schwer machen und auch den vater trösten wenn er weinen sollte und ihm erzählen wie ich dir gesagt daß ihr mir nachkommen werdet denn das täublein wird bald kommen mir ist als höre ich schon seinen flügelschlag",
		"sie tat es sonst alle morgen denn ich streute ihr futter dahin aber heute hatte ich nicht den mut und gedachte ach da kömmt die taube schon welche die mutter mitnehmen will aber ich soll ihr den abschied nicht schwer machen",
		"um meine wiege laß seide nicht laß deinen arm sich schlingen und nur deiner milden augen licht laß zu mir niederdringen",
		"da sagte sie die nachtigall sehnt sich und lobet gott also tue ich auch",
		"ich fand mich gleich einem neugebornen kinde welches mit allem spielet und noch nicht beten kann und erst nach einiger erfahrung in der süßigkeit des lebens seine hände zum danke falten lernet",
		"glaubte auch schier in meiner einfalt der himmel sei golden um meines besten willen die schwalbe habe nur gesungen mir glück zu wünschen und der türmer habe allein so lieblich geblasen mir zur feier da der himmel sich doch nur gerötet vor der sonne die der herr gerufen da die schwalbe doch nur gesungen in gottes frühlingslust und der wächter nur geblasen zu gottes ehren ja wohl gern noch ein stündlein geschlafen hätte so es ihm von den münsterherren verstattet wäre",
		"so wie die lieben kinder durch die blumen gehen und sie brechen und kränze winden und sich bei den händen fassen und mit den kränzen im kreise tanzen gleichsam selbst ein lebendiger blumenkranz wie sie aber nicht gedenken der frucht im treibenden sommer und der ernte im reichen herbst und des todes in dem trüben tiefsinnigen winter also wandelte auch ich armer schelm wie ein einfältiges kind ohne witz durch den garten und konnte vor großer bewegung über mein neues glück das mir gestern früh noch nicht geträumt hatte nicht zum gebete gelangen",
		"elslein mein kind sage hast du den lieben heiland gesehn wo ist er hingegangen",
		"da hörte ich den flügelschlag einer taube durch die luft und ich rief abermals mit großer sehnsucht hüter ist die nacht schier hin",
		"da zog ich ein buch aus meinem buchbeutel und sprach ich will es euch lesen denn ich habe angefangen es mir aufzuschreiben und zwar so recht ausführlich wie es mir eingefallen mit allerlei rede und betrachtung wie mir bewußt ward daß es gewesen ist und gewesen sein kann",
		"vor kloster arnstein reichten sie sich die hände und trennten sich mit der gegenseitigem versicherung miteinander in christlicher ehe zu leben",
		"jetzt aber will ich dir vieles erzählen denn ich glaube es wird dir frommen wenn du früh weißt wie auf erden viel traurigkeit ist und im himmel allein die freude die wir durch unwandelbare treue und stärke in dem irdischen leide allein verdienen können",
		"da ward ich mir so recht lebendig ihrer liebe bewußt und genoß ihrer güte mit kindlicher freude denn sie pflegte mich sonst nicht zu tragen weil sie wenn gleich groß und schlank doch durch manche sorge und nachtwache entkräftet war",
		"da sagte sie auf einmal mein liebes kind du hast wohl geträumt aber die barmherzigkeit gottes ist groß denn sieh mein diener trägt ein solches kraut in einem feuchten tuche eingeschlagen in seinem wadsack auf dem rücken dies kraut aber wächst nicht hier zu lande sondern habe ich es im kloster arnstein wo ich zur beichte war von dem gärtner erhalten der es von einem priester aus fremden landen jenseits des meeres hat",
		"ich empfand große bangigkeit um ihre rührende gebärde",
		"da fragte mich die edelfrau els was weinst du",
		"amen",
		"o mutter halte dein kindlein warm die welt ist kalt und helle und trag es fromm bist du zu arm hin an des grabes schwelle",
		"die gewaltige künstlichkeit des wunderwürdigen münsterturms hätte mich beinahe wieder niedergeschlagen denn ich bedachte mit verwunderung wie ich doch unter den hohen eichen in finstern wäldern auf hohen bergen an steilen abgründen und bei stürzenden wasserfällen in einsamen tälern recht in einöde ja ganz verlassen auch wohl gar hungrig gesessen und mich doch nicht so bewegt gefühlt als bei dem anblick dieses turmes",
		"zwischen der arbeit schaute ich oft nach ihr sah auch mit freude wie der anblick der gegend ihr antlitz zu erheitern schien und als ich meine ernte ihr darbot lächelte sie freundlich strich mir mit der hand über die stirne und sagte schönen dank johannes du bist ein gutes kind",
		"die edelfrau ist auch mit zu grabe gewesen und da sie nach der laurenburg kehrte brachte sie ihren herrn den ritter von der laurenburg und den ältern sohn johann mit welchem der alte laurenburger bei dem grafen zu nassau gewesen der des johann taufpate war und hatte die laurenburgerin ihnen auf der heimkehr begegnet",
		"der aber kam uns nachgelaufen und brachte den korb da war ein schönes weißes klosterbrot drinnen und ein krüglein voll weins das schenkte uns der herr abt",
		"da hörte ich ein glöcklein im walde und sah bald meinen vater kommen der trug eine leuchte und zwei ordensherren gingen mit ihm deren einer trug das hochwürdige gut und der andere das heilige öl und ihnen folgten einige fromme männer und frauen die stille beteten",
		"der ritter aber sprach hierauf johannes wie gefällt dir deine neue heimat bist du zufrieden bei mir",
		"aber du mußtest gehen wie hagar mit deinem ismael durch die dornen in der wüste",
		"standen die tränlein nicht auf den wangen wie die tautröpflein auf diesen rosen gingst du nicht durch den wald wie ein lüftlein durch die blüten und waren deine augen nicht getreu und süß schauend wie die blauen veilchen deine lippen nicht wie die rosinfarbenen nelken und flog dein gelbes haar nicht wie der sonnenschein",
		"kühl dich in liebeswogen",
		"komm elslein sagte der ritter dann zu mir ich will dich selbst zu deinem vater bringen es ist noch hoch am tage und mag er wohl trostes bedürfen",
		"ich hatte ihn gestern nicht recht gesehen denn es dunkelte schon da er mich am wege barmherzig zu sich nahm",
		"sie erwachte in meinen armen und als ich ihr die ursache meiner tränen sagte nahm sie meine hände von ihrem hals und faltete sie und schloß sie in ihre lieben hände und so beteten wir zusammen zu gott und dankten ihm daß er uns diese nacht erhalten und uns verliehen habe diesen tag zu unserer besserung anzutreten",
		"da rührte das niederrinnende blut meinen guten vater er trat zu dem leidenden tiere zog ihm den bolz aus dem auge und wusch ihm die wunde mit wasser aus welches alles der hirsch ruhig geschehen ließ",
		"die mutter stand stille und schaute ruhig in die gegend hinein ich hatte aber den deckel des korbes genommen ihn mit breiten haselnußblättern bedeckt und sammelte mit ängstlichem fleiße die schönsten brombeeren und himbeeren und was sonst an wohlschmeckenden träublein zu reichlicher lese sich darbot",
		"dann aber auch ward mir gegeben viele irdische herrlichkeit und was zum leben nötig und lustig ist denn ich ward gelehret daß der glanz der sonne all mein gold sei der spiegel der flüsse all mein silber die grünen wiesen mit ihren blumen all meine teppiche und tapezereien der himmel mit seinen blauen gestirnten gewölben und der grüne hohe wald alle meine gebäude und hallen ja endlich bin ich so reich geworden daß mir die ganze welt offen stand und alle guten menschen meine diener warden zu denen ich sprechen durfte gib mir dies gib mir jenes und hatte ich auch keinen herrn als den herrn aller herren den lieben gott der mir das leben zu einem leben gegeben und in dessen hände ich es so der heilige geist seine gnade verleiht und mein herr jesus sich meiner erbarmt ohne große makel zurückzugeben hoffe und habe ich mir zum spruche auf mein schild erwählt denn ich bin eines ritters sohn der himmel ist mein hut die erde ist mein schuh das heilge kreuz ist mein schwert wer mich sieht hat mich lieb und wert",
		"denn er hat uns ja das gebet gelehret und er ist die hand in welche wir unsre hände legen müssen so unser gebet zu gott dringen soll denn er selbst hat auf erden gesagt alle dinge sind mir übergeben von meinem vater und niemand erkennet den sohn als nur der vater und niemand kennet den vater als nur der sohn und wem es der sohn will offenbaren",
		"so oft der mond mag scheinen gedenk ich dein allein mein herz ist klar und rein gott wolle uns vereinen",
		"ich trat mit scheu hinein denn die wenigen strahlen welche durch die verschlossenen fensterladen fielen zeigten mir allerlei große vögel an den wänden in unbestimmtem lichte",
		"er ist zu gott gegangen vor zehn jahren und liegt begraben auf dem kirchhofe zu kloster arnstein",
		"nun aber nahm meine mutter linnen das sie gewebt und garn das sie gesponnen und gezwirnet um es in dem kloster zu verkaufen",
		"und sie sprach ja er will schlafen gehn in die ewige ruhe",
		"wie arm ich bin darf ich zu dir doch kommen die mängel hat dein treuer sinn ja all von mir genommen",
		"ach wiedersehen geht fern und weit und nahe geht das scheiden",
		"wir weinten um ihn wie um einen treuen und dankbaren freund und hat ihn mein vater unter demselben baume wo er ihn geschossen begraben sein geweih aber in den baum so befestigt daß es zu ewigem gedächtnis in denselben verwachsen noch zu sehen ist und hat mein vater diese hütte wegen des treuen hirschen hirzentreu genannt",
		"nun hatte ich den mut nicht mehr nach dem bilde zu schauen und ward mir mein großvater von damals an ein gar ernster und sorglicher gedanke aber ich habe zum ersten male gebetet mit einer recht innerlichen herzensangst wie früher nie warum ich aber so gebetet kann ich mich nicht mehr deutlich entsinnen",
		"vater unser der du im himmel bist unser täglich brot gib uns heute getreuer gott herr jesus christ tränk uns aus deiner seite du strahlender augenhimmel du du taust aus mutteraugen ach herzenspochen ach lust ach ruh an deinen brüsten saugen",
		"da rief ich wer da",
		"brichts nicht in freud brichts doch in leid bricht es uns allen beiden",
		"dachte ich bei mir selbst und schaute zum morgenlichte hin und sprach du bist mein licht du wirst mein tag",
		"aber warum sie weine sagte sie mir damals nicht",
		"nun aber bedenke ich ob dein fröhlicher mut mir wohl diese last von der brust nehmen wird aber das mag wohl nicht sein hast du mich nicht gefunden hier im grünen in einem lustigen garten von der lieben sonne beschienen und angesungen von den unschuldigen vögelein nachdenklich und betrübt",
		"einem edelmann wächst solcher wein nicht um die lanze der schmeckt nach dem krummstab",
		"gut freund",
		"da ward ich erst reich über alle maßen da hatte ich das ewige leben und den schlüssel des himmels geschenket",
		"besonders traurig aber kam es mir vor daß der vogel und meine mutter zugleich sangen und doch nicht recht miteinander und hätte ich damals wohl wissen mögen ob der vogel auch in seinem gesange meiner mutter gedachte und ob er auch lieber geweint als gesungen hätte",
		"da fühltest du dich so still so fromm in dich hinabgezogen",
		"nun ritt die edelfrau mit mir und ihrem söhnlein allein vollends zur lahn hinab und an einer seichten stelle hinüber nach der laurenburg wohin der diener bald auch kam und mich auf dem kahne zu meinen eltern hieher zurückbrachte",
		"meine mutter aber wollte das geld nicht wieder nehmen und sprach der himmel segne euch hochwürdiger herr für eure milde aber ich bedarf des geldes nicht welches ich zu heiligem opfer erarbeitet tut des edlen laurenburgers weib den schimpf nicht an als könne sie nicht ein kleines opfer erarbeiten",
		"ich habe ja schon gebetet",
		"das erste dessen ich mich aus frühster jugend von meiner mutter recht deutlich erinnre ist daß sie mich lehrte mich mit dem zeichen des heiligen kreuzes zu bezeichnen und die hände zu falten und das vaterunser und den englischen gruß zu beten",
		"so stand ich leise leise von der seite der mutter auf und ging hinaus und kniete an dem bächlein in das gras und betete für sie",
		"so zogen wir still und einsam wohl eine stunde lang durch den dichten wald als wären wir die einzigen menschen auf der welt und hätten nicht viel freude",
		"er war aber im kampf mit andern hirschen welche ihm seines blinden auges wegen überlegen waren so heftig verwundet daß er mit anbrechendem tage zu den füßen meiner eltern starb",
		"da fragte ich sie weiter will denn der alte laurenburger auch schlafen gehn",
		"da meine mutter dies sah fuhr es wie ein blitz durch ihre augen und umarmte sie mich heftig in der kirche aber ihre wangen wurden schamrot und ihre augen voll tränen da ließ sie mich los und senkte das haupt auf den betstuhl",
		"ach warum ward nicht dir so ein garten und so ein haus und warum wohnest du zwischen fünf brettern und zwei brettlein und bist deines lebens nicht froh geworden noch deines todes",
		"dieses stellte aber einen alten ritter vor der hatte ein langes geistliches gewand an und legte einem jungen ritter der vor ihm kniete die hände auf das haupt",
		"da ich nun weiß wo schlafen und wo brot finden und wem dienen um des herren willen da weiß ich nun auch wen lieben wem danken außer gott und für wen beten außer für mich herr meine neue heimat gefällt mir wohl gott gebe daß ich auch ihr wohlgefalle und ihrer würdig werde",
		"meine mutter ließ aber von dem geld das er ihr für die linnen gegeben zurück eine heilige messe für ihr anliegen in sankt jörgen kapelle zu lesen und da der abt fragte laurenburgerin was ist euer anliegen",
		"gewiß sagte die mutter wenn die so es tun sich so lieben wie wir aber den lieben gott doch noch viel mehr als einander und wenn in der kirche alle leute zusammen beten und der priester am altare betet da ist das gebet des priesters die hand in die sie alle ihre hände gefalten haben",
		"der abt erwiderte hierauf mit ernster und freundlicher stimme laurenburgerin nehmet euer geld zurück und wendet es eurem kinde zu ich weiß ihr lebet bedrängt ich will das heilige meßopfer selbsten für euch halten und von ganzem herzen für euch beten aber ergebet euch auch in den willen des herrn und hanget nicht weltlichem kummer allzu sehr nach",
		"da lachte der abt und sprach lieber hans wenn die schöne laurenburger els mit in den zellen wohnen dürfte möchte wohl das kleine klosterpförtlein zu enge werden so viele sollten den heiligen orden suchen aber das geht nicht denn der herr spricht wir sollen das kreuz auf uns nehmen alles verlassen und ihm nachfolgen und doch wohnet eine mutter mit uns in unsern zellen die ist noch viel lieblicher und milder als die deine",
		"man fühlet da wohl daß der mensch etwas sein und schaffen kann was viel herrlicher ist als sein gewöhnliches sein und schaffen und man erschrickt darüber daß diese herrlichkeit so fremd und selten ist daher wohl eine menge sprossen auf der leiter zu dieser vollkommenheit wo nicht fehlen doch unsichtbar sein müssen und wir alle wohl tief herunter geworfen sind",
		"was es aber für eine beschaffenheit mit ihm habe will ich hier niederschreiben so viel ich erfahren wenn ich zu der zeit in meinem leben gelange da es mir selbst bekannt worden",
		"elslein komm wieder",
		"nach einiger zeit aber trat die edelfrau heraus und nahm mich mit in die hütte da lag die mutter ganz still und der vater kniete an ihrem bette und weinte da ich zu ihm trat hob er mich zur mutter und sprach agnes segne das elslein ehe du scheidest und er legte der mutter hand auf mein haupt",
		"sag herr wird auch ein nestlein fein für mich bei dir gefunden",
		"leg still es wo dein busen bebt und leis herab gebücket harr liebvoll bis es die äuglein hebt zum himmel selig blicket und weck ich dich mit tränen nicht so weck ich dich mit küssen aus deinem aug mein tag anbricht sonn mond dir weichen müssen o du unschuldger himmel du",
		"so schritt ich als suche ich die wildnis nach einem einsamem ungepflegten teile des gartens und kaum stand ich im hohen gras unter hohen linden so konnte ich schon nicht mehr begreifen wie dieser innre schmerz und zorn in mich zum ersten male in meinem leben gekommen sei und gegen die mauer des gartens schreitend sah ich an derselben in einem tiefen bogenraum ein heiligenhäuslein angebracht darinnen war wohlvergittert ein buntgemaltes schnitzwerk die anbetung der heiligen drei könige im stall zu bethlehem aufgestellt",
		"besonders aber befremdete es mich daß meine mutter mit allem dem geräte der hütte ganz vertraut war und in der hütte tat als wäre sie immer darin gewesen darum fragte ich sie mit den worten liebe mutter bleiben wir nun hier ist dies auch unser häuslein",
		"diesen lippen ein einziger kuß",
		"kannst du o grausamer mich mit solchen worten betrüben",
		"denkst du nun wieder zu bilden freund",
		"ehret wen ihr auch wollt",
		"griechen stifteten sie und immer riefen nur griechen selbst in den mauern roms kommt zur geheiligten nacht fern entwich der profane da bebte der wartende neuling den ein weißes gewand zeichen der reinheit umgab",
		"cäsarn wär ich wohl nie zum fernen britannien gefolget florus hätte mich leicht in die popine geschleppt",
		"und so gleichen wir euch o römische sieger",
		"hast du ihr einen heroen herauf zu führen geboten",
		"nun bin ich endlich geborgen",
		"herkules ist es nicht mehr den dir alkmene geboren seine verehrung für mich macht ihn auf erden zum gott",
		"einem dichter zuliebe verkürze die herrlichen stunden die mit begierigem blick selig der maler genießt glühend blicke noch schnell zu diesen hohen fassaden kuppeln und säulen zuletzt und obelisken herauf stürze dich eilig ins meer um morgen früher zu sehen was jahrhunderte schon göttliche lust dir gewährt diese feuchten mit rohr so lange bewachsnen gestade diese mit bäumen und busch düster beschatteten höhn",
		"wenn das volk mich verklagt ich muß es dulden",
		"freue dich also lebendger der lieberwärmeten stätte ehe den fliehenden fuß schauerlich lethe dir netzt",
		"ein halb stündchen noch währts bis zum geläute der nacht unglückseliger",

		"siehe dir bin ich nun gar nach rom gefolget",
		"warum bist du geliebter nicht heute zur vigne gekommen",
		"laß dich geliebte nicht reun daß du mir so schnell dich ergeben",

		"es traf sich daß kohlhaas eben mit dem rücken gegen die wand auf einem bund stroh saß und sein ihm in herzberg erkranktes kind mit semmel und milch fütterte als die herrschaften um ihn zu besuchen in die meierei traten und da die dame ihn um ein gespräch einzuleiten fragte wer er sei",

		"daraus aber folge nicht daß man ihm wegen dieser frevelhaften selbstrache amnestie erteilen müsse zwei rechtsbegriffe die der doktor luther sowohl als auch der staatsrat zu verwechseln scheine",
		"sie machte anstalten in wenig wochen sobald sie ihre niederkunft überstanden haben würde ihren schönen aber durch die lange abwesenheit ein wenig verfallenen landsitz wieder herzustellen saß in der gartenlaube und dachte während sie kleine mützen und strümpfe für kleine beine strickte wie sie die zimmer bequem verteilen würde auch welches sie mit büchern füllen und in welchem die staffelei am schicklichsten stehen würde",
		"fragte die marquise und stand auf und ich sollte hier",
		"die frau deren anwesenheit in aachen gänzlich nutzlos war ging mit zurücklassung eines kleinen kapitals das sie zum besten ihrer armen söhne bei den gerichten niederlegte nach dem haag zurück wo sie ein jahr darauf durch diesen vorfall tief bewegt in den schoß der katholischen kirche zurückkehrte die söhne aber starben im späten alter eines heitern und vergnügten todes nachdem sie noch einmal ihrer gewohnheit gemäß das gloria in excelsis abgesungen hatten",
		"die jünglinge die sich bei ihm niedergesetzt hatten fragten was ihm fehle",
		"kohlhaas über eine so unverschämte forderung betreten sagte dem junker der sich die wamsschöße frierend vor den leib hielt daß er die rappen ja verkaufen wolle doch dieser da in demselben augenblick ein windstoß eine ganze last von regen und hagel durchs tor jagte rief um der sache ein ende zu machen wenn er die pferde nicht loslassen will so schmeißt ihn wieder über den schlagbaum zurück und ging ab",
		"warum griff er nach der pistole aber ich beschwöre sie du sollst nicht versetzte frau von g indem sie die tochter wieder auf ihren sessel niederdrückte",
		"er legte sich mit klopfendem herzen in das fenster des korridors von wo aus er ohne seine absicht zu verraten den eingang des zimmers beobachten konnte und schon glaubte er bei einem geräusch das sich ganz leise am riegel erhob den unschätzbaren augenblick da er die scheinheilige entlarven könne gekommen als statt des unbekannten den er erwartete elvire selbst ohne irgend eine begleitung mit einem ganz gleichgültigen und ruhigen blick den sie aus der ferne auf ihn warf aus dem zimmer hervortrat",
		"denn da ein geistlicher lutherischer religion zu welchem eben damals aufkeimenden glauben sie sich nach dem beispiel ihres mannes bekannt hatte neben ihrem bette stand und ihr mit lauter und empfindlich feierlicher stimme ein kapitel aus der bibel vorlas so sah sie ihn plötzlich mit einem finstern ausdruck an nahm ihm als ob ihr daraus nichts vorzulesen wäre die bibel aus der hand blätterte und blätterte und schien etwas darin zu suchen und zeigte dem kohlhaas der an ihrem bette saß mit dem zeigefinger den vers vergib deinen feinden tue wohl auch denen die dich hassen",
		"welch eine schändliche anklage auf den mord meines bruders wider mich zusammengeschmiedet worden ist",
		"doch die antwort die der turmwächter von ihr nach mehrmaligem rütteln derselben am arm da sie wie eine wahnsinnige ohne zu hören und zu sehen auf dem stroh lag empfangen zu haben vorgab war nein sie wolle so lange sie auf erden sei keinen menschen mehr sehen ja man erfuhr daß sie noch an demselben tage dem schloßvogt in einer eigenhändigen zuschrift befohlen hatte niemanden wer es auch sei den kämmerer von trota aber am allerwenigsten zu ihr zu lassen dergestalt daß herr friedrich von der heftigsten bekümmernis über ihren zustand getrieben an einem tage an welchem er seine kraft besonders lebhaft wiederkehren fühlte mit erlaubnis des schloßvogts aufbrach und sich ihrer verzeihung gewiß ohne bei ihr angemeldet worden zu sein in begleitung seiner mutter und beiden schwestern nach ihrem zimmer verfügte",
		"aber leider",
		"rief die marquise und streckte ihre arme nach ihm aus",
		"die marquise suchte sie mit liebkosungen und beschwörungen ohne ende zu trösten doch der abend kam heran und mitternacht schlug ehe es ihr gelang",
		"jeronimo nahm josephen nachdem sich beide in diesen betrachtungen stillschweigend erschöpft hatten beim arm und führte sie mit unaussprechlicher heiterkeit unter den schattigen lauben des granatwaldes auf und nieder",
		"fiel ihm der graf ins wort begleitete den adjutanten zum wagen und öffnete ihm die tür",
		"ist eine bank voll gerichtsdienern und schergen die einen brief der gebracht wird unterschlagen oder ein erkenntnis das sie abliefern sollen zurückhalten deine obrigkeit",
		"sie stürzte den mondschein der sie zu verraten drohte sorgsam vermeidend hinter die vorhänge des fensters und hörte auch schon die mutter welche dem neger von allem was während dessen vorgefallen war auch von der anwesenheit des europäischen flüchtlings im hause nachricht gab",
		"der graf nach einer kurzen pause in welcher er alle merkmale der größten unruhe gegeben hatte sagte indem er sich zur mutter wandte daß er sein äußerstes getan hätte um dieser geschäftsreise auszuweichen daß die schritte die er deshalb beim general en chef und dem general k seinem onkel gewagt hätte die entscheidendsten gewesen wären die sich hätten tun lassen daß man aber geglaubt hätte ihn dadurch aus einer schwermut aufzurütteln die ihm von seiner krankheit noch zurückgeblieben wäre und daß er sich jetzt völlig dadurch ins elend gestürzt sehe die familie wußte nicht was sie zu dieser äußerung sagen sollte",
		"dieser kinder",
		"und hinzusetzte er finde sich nach auflösung seines kriegshaufens der ihm erteilten landesherrlichen freiheit gemäß in dresden ein um seine klage der rappen wegen gegen den junker wenzel von tronka vor gericht zu bringen",
		"er nahm die hundert goldgülden die ihm der amtmann schon für die ställe in dresden zugefertigt hatte und bestellte ein leichenbegräbnis das weniger für sie als für eine fürstin angeordnet schien ein eichener sarg stark mit metall beschlagen kissen von seide mit goldnen und silbernen troddeln und ein grab von acht ellen tiefe mit feldsteinen gefüttert und kalk",
		"rief er und drang mit noch ungesättigter mordlust von neuem vor",
		"nachdem er ihm zuvörderst wegen seines eignen edelmütigen verhaltens eine kurze lobrede gehalten hatte wobei der graf über das ganze gesicht rot ward schloß er daß er die schandkerle die den namen des kaisers brandmarkten niederschießen lassen wolle und befahl ihm zu sagen wer sie seien",
		"übergab die kinder nachdem er sie noch einmal vom boden erhoben und an seine brust gedrückt hatte dem amtmann von kohlhaasenbrück und trat während dieser sie unter stillen tränen vom platz hinwegführte an den block",
		"eher antwortete die marquise daß die gräber befruchtet werden und sich dem schoße der leichen eine geburt entwickeln wird",
		"sie beschlossen sobald die erderschütterungen aufgehört haben würden nach la conception zu gehen wo josephe eine vertraute freundin hatte sich mit einem kleinen vorschuß den sie von ihr zu erhalten hoffte von dort nach spanien einzuschiffen wo jeronimos mütterliche verwandten wohnten und daselbst ihr glückliches leben zu beschließen",
		"wenige tage nachher erhielt der kommandant in beziehung auf diesen zeitungsartikel einen brief von der marquise in welchem sie ihn da ihr die gnade versagt wäre in seinem hause erscheinen zu dürfen auf eine ehrfurchtsvolle und rührende art bat denjenigen der sich am dritten morgens bei ihm zeigen würde gefälligst zu ihr nach v hinauszuschicken",
		"hier verfaßte er mit hülfe eines rechtsgelehrten den er kannte eine beschwerde in welcher er nach einer umständlichen schilderung des frevels den der junker wenzel von tronka an ihm sowohl als an seinem knecht herse verübt hatte auf gesetzmäßige bestrafung desselben wiederherstellung der pferde in den vorigen stand und auf ersatz des schadens antrug den er sowohl als sein knecht dadurch erlitten hatten",
		"in sainte lüze",
		"hierauf traf die mutter mehrere die sicherheit des fremden wie sie sagte abzweckende veranstaltungen befahl toni die fensterladen zu verschließen und zündete selbst um die nacht die dadurch in dem zimmer herrschend geworden war zu zerstreuen an einem auf dem kaminsims befindlichen feuerzeug nicht ohne mühseligkeit indem der zunder nicht fangen wollte ein licht an",
		"bei diesem anblick stürzt die marquise mit sträubenden haaren aus dem zimmer und während der marchese der den degen ergriffen wer da",
		"von zeit zu zeit holte er sich mit stillen und geräuschlosen bewegungen eine handvoll nüsse aus der tasche die er bei sich trug und während piachi sich die tränen vom auge wischte nahm er sie zwischen die zähne und knackte sie auf",
		"man soll sogleich anspannen sagte sie indem sie in die ihrigen trat setzte sich matt bis in den tod auf einen sessel nieder zog ihre kinder eilfertig an und ließ die sachen einpacken",
		"er mochte wohl eine viertelstunde in der tiefsten bewußtlosigkeit gelegen haben als er endlich wieder erwachte und sich mit nach der stadt gekehrtem rücken halb auf dem erdboden erhob",
		"die brüder die gegenwärtig waren hoben ihn bestürzt vom boden auf und riefen einen arzt herbei der zu seiner pflege in den nebengebäuden wohnte aber alle mühe ihn wieder ins leben zurück zu bringen war umsonst er gab während frau littegarde besinnungslos in dem schoß ihrer frauen lag seinen geist auf und diese da sie erwachte hatte auch nicht den letzten bittersüßen trost ihm ein wort zur verteidigung ihrer ehre in die ewigkeit mitgegeben zu haben",
		"rief donna constanze und floh zu ihrem schwager doch klostermetze",
		"dabei stand ein gewitter dunkelschwarz mit vergoldeten rändern im hintergrunde des baus dasselbe hatte schon über die gegend von aachen ausgedonnert und nachdem es noch einige kraftlose blitze gegen die richtung wo der dom stand geschleudert hatte sank es zu dünsten aufgelöst mißvergnügt murmelnd in osten herab",
		"ich verschwieg ihnen nichts meine mutter",
		"donna elvire möchte sich beruhigen und führte seine dame weiter",
		"piachi setzte sich nieder und antwortete mit verstellter schrift im namen xavieras gleich noch vor nacht in der magdalenenkirche",
		"kohlhaas während dadurch herbeigerufen ein famulus sich mit licht in dem vorsaal meldete stand betreten indem er sich die augen trocknete vom boden auf und da der famulus vergebens weil der riegel vorgeschoben war an der türe wirkte luther aber sich wieder zu seinen papieren niedergesetzt hatte so machte kohlhaas dem mann die türe auf",
		"nehmt ihn rief er indem er sich umkehrte den häschern zu und übergebt ihn gleich gerichtet wie er ist den henkern er möge zur brandmarkung seines andenkens auf jenem scheiterhaufen verderben auf welchem wir eben um seinetwillen im begriff waren zwei unschuldige zu opfern",
		"niemand bei dem licht der sonne sprach das mädchen als meine mutter und ich",

		"der kurfürst sagte er müsse ihm nur gestehen daß der anblick eines nichtigen zettels den der mann in einer bleiernen kapsel mit sich führe schuld an dem ganzen unangenehmen zufall sei der ihm zugestoßen",
		"setzt euch und hört mich an unter den engeln deren psalmen ihr aufschreibt seid ihr nicht sicherer als bei mir",
		"die marquise antwortete liebste mutter",
		"frau von g antwortete daß sie von dieser maßregel unterrichtet wäre daß er aber gleichwohl nur gehen und die obristin von g bei ihr anmelden möchte",
		"und drückte der alten hand und wollte nur wissen was für antworten auf die ungeheuren fragen im zettel enthalten wären",
		"verhaften sie ihn wenn sie die güte haben wollen nebst dieser jungen dame zu ihrer beiderseitigen sicherheit und diesen nichtswürdigen indem er meister pedrillo ergriff der den ganzen aufruhr angezettelt hat",
		"doch xaviera in deren brust das bittere gefühl der eifersucht rege geworden war warf einen blick auf ihn sie sagte indem sie vor den spiegel trat zuletzt sei es gleichgültig wer die person sei empfahl sich ihm ziemlich kalt und verließ das zimmer",
		"du unglücklicher sagte littegarde indem sie sich zurück zog wie kannst du dem was dir mein mund sagt glauben schenken warum nicht",
		"rief luther indem er ihn ansah",
		"jene versetzte darauf nein eher nicht von deinen füßen weich ich bis du mir sagst ob du mir die niedrigkeit meines verhaltens du herrliche überirdische verzeihen kannst",
		"sie fragte was der junge portugiese verschuldet den man unter dem torweg kürzlich mit keulen zu boden geworfen habe",
		"wenn dein bewußtsein dich rein spricht wie kann dich ein urteil und wäre es das einer ganzen konsulta von ärzten nur kümmern",
		"es mochte ohngefähr mitternacht sein und die lichter im schlosse schimmerten noch als sie äußerst ermüdet von der reise mit ihrem fuhrwerk daselbst ankam",
		"und da ich sage die raubhunde",
		"der graf f den unvermeidliche geschäfte in neapel aufhielten hatte inzwischen zum zweitenmal an die marquise geschrieben und sie aufgefordert es möchten fremde umstände eintreten welche da wollten ihrer ihm gegebenen stillschweigenden erklärung getreu zu bleiben",
		"die marquise versicherte sehr wohl und wollte nur wissen wie er ins leben erstanden sei",
		"und damit wandte sie sich warf sich auf einen sessel nieder und weinte",
		"und da ich dem schloßvogt der sie daselbst einquartierte die rappen aus der hand nahm und fragte wo die tiere jetzo bleiben sollten so zeigte er mir einen schweinekoben an der von latten und brettern an der schloßmauer auferbaut war du meinst unterbrach ihn kohlhaas es war ein so schlechtes behältnis für pferde daß es einem schweinekoben ähnlicher war als einem stall",
		"noch hätte er keines jungen mannes bekanntschaft gemacht der in so kurzer zeit so viele vortreffliche eigenschaften des charakters entwickelt hätte",
		"antwortete kohlhaas",
		"und nachher seine lippen auf immer geschlossen hätte",
		"stehen sie auf rief die marquise ich beschwöre sie du hörst sagte frau von g ich will wissen ob du mich noch lieben und so aufrichtig verehren kannst als sonst",
		"man vermietete in den straßen durch welche der hinrichtungszug gehen sollte die fenster man trug die dächer der häuser ab und die frommen töchter der stadt luden ihre freundinnen ein um dem schauspiele das der göttlichen rache gegeben wurde an ihrer schwesterlichen seite beizuwohnen",
		"ja",
		"man trug sie alle bei der finsternis der einbrechenden nacht in don alonzos wohnung wohin don fernando ihnen viel über das antlitz des kleinen philipp weinend folgte",
		"versetzte der kämmerer unwillig",
		"ein einziges heimliches geflüstertes",
		"frau von g stieg von ihrem jäger unterstützt aus und hob die marquise nicht ohne einige bewegung vom boden auf",
		"solch eine miene",
		"mittlerweile setzte die rückkehr des eilboten mit der kurfürstlichen resolution die stadt in neue besorgnis",
		"sie fragte ihn ob er sich nicht setzen wolle",
		"demnach blieb dem prior fast nichts übrig als an eine täuschung des grafen selbst durch eine dritte ihm unbekannte person zu glauben und noch hatte der unglückliche der bei der nachricht von der wunderbaren wiederherstellung des kämmerers selbst auf diesen schrecklichen gedanken geriet das ende seines lebens nicht erreicht als sich dieser glaube schon zu seiner verzweiflung vollkommen bestätigte",
		"viele grafen und herren aus den edelsten und begütertsten geschlechtern des landes fanden sich mit ihren werbungen bei solchen gelegenheiten um sie ein und unter diesen war ihr herr friedrich von trota der kämmerer der ihr einst auf der jagd gegen den anlauf eines verwundeten ebers tüchtiger weise das leben gerettet hatte der teuerste und liebste inzwischen hatte sie sich aus besorgnis ihren beiden auf die hinterlassenschaft ihres vermögens rechnenden brüdern dadurch zu mißfallen aller ermahnungen ihres vaters ungeachtet noch nicht entschließen können ihm ihre hand zu geben",
		"joseph dem schlafen über alles geht nimmt es gewaltig übel so mutwillig gestört zu werden und in der meinung die gestalt sei der onkel gewesen der ihn habe necken wollen fängt er an sich laut zu beklagen und sich derartige scherze scheltend zu verbitten",
		"als man dem junker ein wams angelegt und einen helm aufgesetzt hatte und er die brust wegen mangels an luft noch halb offen am arm des landvogts und seines schwagers des grafen von gerschau auf der straße erschien stiegen gotteslästerliche und entsetzliche verwünschungen gegen ihn zum himmel auf",
		"und ihn an donna constanzens seite mit einem ungeheuren keulenschlage zu boden streckte",
		"worauf dieser über den besuch den er erblickte ein wenig befremdet den hausschlüssel von der wand nahm und sich auf die entfernung desselben wartend unter die halboffene tür des zimmers zurückbegab",
		"in dem kirchenstaat herrscht ein gesetz nach welchem kein verbrecher zum tode geführt werden kann bevor er die absolution empfangen",
		"sagte er zu den rittern kehrte sich um und wollte nach dem schlosse gehen",
		"die mutter sagte es wäre wohl nicht möglich daß er depeschen mit denen er nach neapel ginge nach z zurückschicken wolle bloß weil es ihm nicht gelungen wäre auf seiner durchreise durch m in einer fünf minuten langen unterredung von einer ihm ganz unbekannten dame ein jawort zu erhalten",
		"jeronimo dachte eben auch wie er nahrung für die seinigen herbeischaffen sollte als ein junger wohlgekleideter mann mit einem kinde auf dem arm zu josephen trat und sie mit bescheidenheit fragte ob sie diesem armen wurme dessen mutter dort unter den bäumen beschädigt liege nicht auf kurze zeit ihre brust reichen wolle",
		"sie sagte während der obrist noch mit einer nichtssagenden miene in das papier hineinsah sie habe einen einfall",
		"der graf erhob sich weinend",
		"sie kochte ihm für den abend alles was sie nur stärkendes und beruhigendes aufzutreiben wußte in der küche zusammen bereitete und wärmte ihm das bett um ihn sogleich hineinzulegen sobald er nur an der hand der tochter erscheinen würde und schlich da er immer noch nicht kam und schon die abendtafel gedeckt war dem zimmer der marquise zu um doch zu hören was sich zutrage",
		"einst in einer unglücklichen nacht da feuer das haus ergriff und gleich als ob es von pech und schwefel erbaut wäre zu gleicher zeit in allen gemächern aus welchen es zusammengesetzt war emporknitterte flüchtete sich überall von flammen geschreckt die dreizehnjährige elvire von treppe zu treppe und befand sich sie wußte selbst nicht wie auf einem dieser balken",
		"gehn sie",

		"wir gingen auf dem breiten steige neben der graft die sich im schatten der bäume breit und schwarz an unsrer seite hinzog",
		"ich wollte anne lene sehen aber ich sah sie nicht",
		"aber noch als ich das gittertor hinter mir zugeworfen hatte und wieder auf die werfte hinaufging hörte ich sie ihre leidenschaftlichen verwünschungen ausstoßen",
		"als wir auf die werfte kamen fanden wir die alte wieb in zank mit einer bettlerin vor der haustür stehen die sie vergeblich abzuweisen suchte",
		"noch sehr wohl erinnere ich mich wie das geläute der glocken die gedämpfte redeweise in der alle die schwarzen leute miteinander verkehrten und die kolossalen florbehangenen wachskerzen welche brennend vor dem sarge hinausgetragen wurden ein angenehmes feiertagsgefühl in mir erregten das dem unwillkürlichen grauen vor diesem gepränge vollkommen die waage hielt",
		"während ich dies betrachtete und eine unbewußte scheu mich hinderte hineinzutreten hörte ich in der tiefe des hauses eine tür gehen und bald darauf sah ich meinen vater mit einem schwarz gekleideten kinde an der hand auf mich zukommen",
		"ich bemerkte dies eigentlich erst als sie eines tages mit veränderter frisur ins zimmer trat",
		"nach einer weile hörte ich drunten im wohnhause aus der im erdgeschoß befindlichen küche das kaffeegeschirr herauftragen das klirren der tassen und kaffeelöffel und endlich vernahm ich auch von der straße her das anfahren der kutsche und bald darauf das aufschlagen der haustür",
		"endlich gingen wir ins haus zurück es war kühl und ich sah die büsche des gartens alle im schatten stehen",
		"als aber anne lene mit der hand nach dem herzen griff und zitternd mit dem atem rang da bat ich sie mit mir in den garten hinabzugehen",
		"gott besser s",
		"freilich die seidenen bändchen sind längst davon und die strümpfe die hat dein großvater selig mir ausgezogen aber wenn dir die schuhe noch gefällig sind",
		"nichts anne lene sagte ich aber gib mir deine hand ich hatte das meer vergessen da hörte ich es plötzlich",
		"er hatte die arme vor sich auf den tisch gestreckt und schien seinen eignen gedanken nachzugehen nur wenn draußen zwischen den sonnigen beeten das kleid des jungen mädchens sichtbar wurde hob er die augenlider und sah nach ihr hinüber",
		"fragte sie und suchte dabei in ihrer stimme vergebens eine innere unruhe zu verbergen",
		"ich trat zu ihr",
		"sonst habe ich niemals einen schmuck an ihr gesehen",
		"er blätterte in seinen büchern umher aber er hatte den alten tanz nicht mehr darin wir mußten uns mit einem walzer begnügen",
		"wieb sagt sie indem sie der alten die hand von der wange zieht wieb ist er tot",
		"sie schien das ziel ihrer wanderung erreicht zu haben denn sie kehrte bei diesen worten um und wir gingen mit dem boten nach dem hofe zurück",
		"es ist grausam sagte sie kopfschüttelnd so eine familie",
		"ein solcher sonntagnachmittag nachdem schon einige jahre in dieser weise vorübergegangen waren ist mir besonders im gedächtnis geblieben ich hatte mich in dem angenehmen bewußtsein des feiertages in unserm hofe umhergetrieben und war endlich in das waschhaus gelangt das am ende desselben lag",
		"da ich in das boskett an der nördlichen seite kam bemerkte ich daß anne lene noch licht in ihrem zimmer habe",
		"die alte wieb fand ich draußen auf dem wege an einem heck stehend von wo ein fußsteig über die fennen nach dem deiche zu führte",
		"endlich aber schien er dessen überdrüssig zu werden er durchstach das tier und ließ es vor sich auf den tisch fallen indem er zugleich eine frage meines vaters beantwortete die seine aufmerksamkeit erregt haben mochte ich hatte wie gebannt diesem vorgange zugesehen und anne lene schien es ebenso ergangen denn ich hörte sie aufatmen wie jemand der von einem auf ihm lastenden druck mit einem male befreit wird",
		"man hörte das leise rupfen des viehes welches jenseits auf der fenne im mondschein graste und drüben von der rohrpflanzung her scholl das zwitschern des rohrsperlings des kleinen wachen nachtgesellen",
		"mich übermannte bei dem anblick meiner jungen hilflosen freundin der zorn und ehe das weib zu einer antwort zeit gewann packte ich sie am arm und zerrte sie den hof hinunter bis hinaus auf den weg",
		"obgleich die seit meiner knabenzeit in mir keimende neigung für anne lene da sie keine erwiderung gefunden niemals zur entfaltung gekommen war so wurde ich doch jetzt durch die nachricht von ihrer verbindung mit einem mir so verhaßten manne auf das heftigste erschüttert und ich darf wohl sagen beunruhigt",
		"als ich ihren namen rief stand sie still und wandte den kopf nach mir zurück",
		"plötzlich aber entstand hinter den fenstern eine starke helligkeit die eine zeitlang in die kahlen büsche des gartens hinausleuchtete und dann allmählich wieder verschwand",
		"aber fuhr sie fort mit einer geheimnisvollen gebärde sich gegen die alte neigend auf deinem heuboden schlafe ich nicht wieder",
		"geh nun trin sagte sie du kannst zur nacht wiederkommen was hast du noch hier zu suchen",
		"auch anne lene hatte ihr teil bekommen aber man wußte kaum waren es spottreden oder unbewußte huldigungen denn alles bezog sich am ende doch nur auf den gegensatz ihres zarten wesens zu der derben und etwas schwerfälligen art des landes",
		"rief sie und wandte sich nach mir um",
		"ja marx erwiderte sie leise und du bist noch so jung",
		"es war so still daß man nichts hörte als das säuseln des schilfs das in den gräben stand",
		"anne lene war nun zwar mit mir in einem hause aber die zeit unsern beisammenseins bestand nicht mehr wie sonst nur in sonntäglichen spielstunden",
		"und wir gingen weiter durch eine verfallene umzäunung in den seitwärts vom hause liegenden gemüsegarten und unten an dem wasser entlang nach den boskettpartien die vor dem hause lagen",
		"für dieses mal nicht liebe mamsell",
		"ich bin oben gewesen die kleine juliane sucht dich mit ihren braunen augen schon in allen ecken",
		"nur einen luxus trieb sie sie trug immer die feinsten englischen handschuhe und da sie dessenungeachtet sich nicht scheute überall damit hinzufassen mußte das getragene paar bald durch ein neues ersetzt werden",
		"aus dem nordertor führt die landschaft eine viertelstunde weges zu einem kirchdorf das mit seinen bäumen und strohdächern weithin auf der ungeheueren wiesenfläche sichtbar ist",
		"desungeachtet ließ ich mir gern was öfters geschah vom vater eine bestellung an sie auftragen",
		"da der hof nur eine halbe stunde von der stadt lag so war uns ein für allemal erlaubt sonntags nach tische dort hinauszugehen",
		"allein man fühlte leicht daß die teilnahme an diesen dingen nur eine äußerliche war eine anstrengung von der sie bald in der einsamkeit ausruhen mußte",
		"sagte die eine musik",
		"schon vorher hatte man mir geschrieben daß das fortdauernder sinken der landpreise den verkauf des staatshofes nötig machen werde und daß anne lene aus einem immerhin noch reichen erbin wahrscheinlich ein armes mädchen geworden sei",
		"endlich brachte ich es heraus und wir liefen an dem wasser entlang bis an die laube in der gartenecke wo die alten erlen ihre zweige in die flut hinabhängen lassen",
		"wir kamen eben von einer fenne wo der pächter wie es dort gebräuchlich ist seine rapssaaternte auf einem großen segel ausdreschen ließ",
		"es tanzt sich heut so schön",
		"sie sind kalt sagte sie sie sollen heiß werden",
		"nach einer weile nahm er die neben ihm liegende schreibfeder tauchte sie in das tintenfaß und begann nun nacheinander kopf und brustschild seines kleinen opfers in langsamen zügen damit zu bestreichen",
		"das herz klopfte mir so laut daß ich immer fürchtete es werde auch ohne worte meine innersten gedanken kundmachen",
		"auch hier hatte sich der sonntag bemerklich gemacht die föhrenen tische waren gescheuert die holländischen klinker womit der boden gepflastert war sahen so feucht und frisch gespült aus dabei war eine so liebliche kühle daß ich mich fast gedankenlos an einen tisch lehnte und auf das träumerische gackeln der hühner lauschte das aus dem anstoßenden hühnerhof zu mir hereindrang",
		"wir mochten auf diese weise bis zum trio gelangt sein als die stubentür sich langsam öffnete und ein dickköpfiger nachbarsjunge hereintrat der sohn eines schuhflickers der mir an werkeltagen bei meinem räuber und soldatenspiel die vortrefflichsten dienste leistete",
		"da mein ohr einmal geweckt war so vernahm ich nun auch aus der ferne das branden der wellen die in der hellen nacht sich draußen über der wüsten geheimnisvollen tiefe wälzten und von der kommenden flut dem strande zugeworfen wurden",
		"da kommt die musik",
		"anne lene stand ihr völlig regungslos gegenüber wieb aber deren augen mit großer ängstlichkeit an ihrer jungen herrin hingen griff in die tasche und drückte der bettlerin eine münze in die hand",
		"etwas später sehe ich die gesellschaft auf den geschlungenen gartenwegen zwischen den blühenden büschen promenieren die alte dame mit der fräse welche am arme meines vaters geht beugt sich zu mir niedere und sagt indem sie mir den kopf aufrichtet du muß dich immer hübsch gerade halten kind",
		"liebe anne lene sagte ich ich bin eben angekommen ich wollte dich noch heute sehen",
		"wenn wir zu lange blieben rief die alte uns wohl herunter und schickte uns in den garten der vor dem hause lag",
		"als ich in das gesindezimmer trat sah ich indessen nur die alte wieb welche eifrig an ihrem strickstrumpf arbeitete",
		"noch auf einen augenblick sah ich die zarten umrisse ihres lieben antlitzes vor einem strahl des milden lichtes beleuchtet dann aber geschah etwas und ging so schnell vorüber daß mein gedächtnis es nicht zu bewahren vermocht hat",
		"sie war infolge derartiger äußerungen schon mehrfach zur strafe gezogen und jetzt schien sie nach dem beiderseitigen betragen zu urteilen fest entschlossen auch der alten dienerin der van der rodenschen familie diese verblaßte geschichte vorzutragen",
		"meine mutter sah mich mit einem durchdringenden blick an und sowohl ich wie anne lene als diese späterhin in ein näheres verhältnis zu unserm hause trat haben noch manche kleine predigt von ihr hören müssen die aus dieser geschichte ihren text genommen hat",
		"ich fühlte wie mir die tränen in die augen schossen",
		"die graft war tief aber ich war kein ungeübter schwimmer ich tauchte unter und meine hände griffen zwischen dem schlüpfrigen kraut umher das auf dem grunde wucherte",
		"wir jungen wenn wir auf unserm schulwege vorübergingen unterließen selten uns auf diese ketten zu setzen und mit tafel und ranzen auf dem rücken einige male hin und her zu schaukeln",
		"aber ich bin hier nicht allein in der gedämpften helligkeit die durch die offene seitenwand aus der angrenzenden loodiele hereinfällt steht ein mädchen meines alters die blonden härchen fallen über ein blaues blusenkleid",
		"als ich aufsah stand anne lene in der tür",
		"wenn dann die enveloppen und tücher abgelegt waren und die beiden damen sich gegenüber an dem sauber servierten tische platz genommen hatten durften auch wir kinder uns an ein nebentischchen setzen und erhielten unsern anteil an den eiermahnen und bieschen oder wie sonst die schönen sachen heißen mochten",
		"anne lene knüpfte ihr schnupftuch um den kopf dann gingen wir wie wir es oft getan um die ecke des hauses und über die werfte nach dem baumgarten zu",
		"auf anne lenes antlitz drückte sich ein erstaunen aus als sei sie durch diese worte wie von etwas völlig unmöglichem betroffen worden",
		"noch rieche ich auf dem dunkeln hausflur den strengen duft der alantwurzel womit die marschbewohner zur abwehr der mücken allabendlich zu räuchern pflegen ich sehe auch noch meinen vater der alten dame die hand küssen dann aber verläßt mich die erinnerung und ich finde mich erst nach einigen stunden wieder auf heu gebettet eine warme sommerliche dämmerung um mich her",
		"sie nickte mir zu ohne weiter heranzutreten und sagte dann du solltest hereinkommen",
		"während meiner freistunden nahmen die eigentlichen knabenspiele einen immer größeren raum ein und ich habe meine kleine freundin nie bewegen können unser räuberspiele mitzumachen oder auch nur in dem türkischen zelte platz zu nehmen das ich von alten teppichen in der spitze eines birnbaumes aufgeschlagen hatte",
		"claus peters trat an den tisch schenkte ihm das glas voll und stieß mit ihm an",
		"wir andern gingen ins haus und besichtigten oben den tanzsaal",
		"es war anne lene ihre augen waren vom weinen gerötet und über der schwarzen florkrause erschienen das blasse gesichtchen und die feinen goldklaren haare noch um vieles zärtlicher als sonst",
		"etwa zwei jahre später um ostern kehrte ich als junger doctor promotus in die heimat zurück",
		"das gehöfte war einst neben vielen andern in besitz der nun gänzlich ausgestorbenen familie van der roden aus der während der beiden letzten jahrhunderte eine reihe von pfennigmeistern und ratmännern der landschaft und bürgermeistern meiner vaterstadt hervorgegangen sind neunzig höfe so hieß es hatten sie gehabt und sich im übermut vermessen das hundert voll zu machen",
		"ich kam noch nicht meine augen hafteten noch an dem weißen sommerkleidchen an der himmelblauen schärpe und zuletzt an einem alten fächer den sie in der hand hielt",
		"ich merkte es kaum als anne lene ihre arme um meinen hals legte und mich küßte während ihre tränen mein gesicht benetzten",
		"drinnen im gesindezimmer fand ich anne lene vor ihrer alten wärterin auf den knien liegen den kopf in ihren schoß gedrückt",
		"ein gefühl der öde und verlorenheit überfiel mich fast ohne es zu wissen stieß ich anne lenes namen hervor und streckte beide arme nach ihr aus",
		"es hat ausgedient sagte sie die schönen schäferpaare wollen sich auch empfehlen",
		"pflückt nur sagte anne lene als eins der mädchen fragend zu ihr umschaute es blüht hier doch für sich allein",
		"etwa auf dem halben wege nach dem haffdeiche der hier nördlich von dem hofe die landschaft gegen das meer hin abschließt sah ich eine weibliche gestalt über die fennen gehen",
		"denn oben an der zimmerdecke gewahrte ich noch die krampe an der einst die kristallkrone über der festtafel des hauses gehangen hatte",
		"aber ich vergesse die raben wieder denn wieb teilt zum dessert noch die zuckertauben von einer konditortorte zwischen uns nur scheint es nicht ganz unparteiisch herzugehen denn anne lene erhält immer die hahnenschwänze und die kragentauben",
		"wir werden hereingerufen und da ich zögere nimmt meine mutter einen zuckerkringel aus dem silbernen kuchenkorb und zeigt mir den",
		"auch schien er in seinen gedanken sich schon als den künftigen besitzer zu betrachten denn als wir später in begleitung des hofmanns zwischen den baulichkeiten herumgingen fand er überall etwas zu tadeln und sprach von verbesserungen die hier vorgenommen werden müßten während der alte marten mit einem mißvergnügten brummen nebenherging",
		"mein vater begrüßte mich und sagte dann indem er seine hand auf den kopf des mädchens legte ihr werdet jetzt geschwister sein anne lene wird als mein mündel von nun an in unserm hause leben denn ihre großmutter deine alte freundin ist gestorben",
		"nach einer weile bewegte sie die hand ein wenig so daß das papier von der flamme des neben ihr auf dem tische stehenden lichtes ergriffen wurde",
		"er wird es bald genug sein antwortete ich das ist nicht mehr zu ändern",
		"darüber war es spät geworden so daß ich nicht mehr zur stadt zurückkehren mochte",
		"hatten wir uns etwas verspätet so trafen wir ihn wohl schon auf unserm wege draußen auf den fennen seinen unzertrennlichen begleiter den springstock auf der schulter und während anne lene auf dem fußbrett um die hecken ging lehrte er mich nach landesweise über die gräben zu setzen",
		"so gelangen wir zu einem gartenpavillon in welchem die gesellschaft bei offenen türen am kaffeetische sitzt",
		"sie schalt auf die bettlerin und redete dies und das von allgemeinen dingen indem sie ihre rauhe hand liebkosend über das haar ihres lieblings hingleiten ließ",
		"die kleine stadt in der meine eltern wohnten lag hart an der grenze der marschlandschaft die bis ans meer mehrere meilen weit ihre grasreiche ebene ausdehnt",
		"nein nein marx",
		"rief ich wir wollen einen kronleuchter machen",
		"oh es ist nicht so kalt sagte sie indem sie das große schaltuch fester um die schultern zog so gingen wir denn weiter",
		"er war zu pferde herausgekommen und rief nun ins haus nach dem hofmann",
		"die alte frau wischte sich mit der schürze über die augen",
		"die dürren zweige welche überall den boden bedeckten knickten unter unsern füßen und über uns von dem geräusch aufgestört flogen die raben von ihren nestern und rauschten mit den flügeln in den blättern",
		"ich zeigte mit dem finger in den baum und sagte sieh nur wie dir das herz klopft",
		"wieb rief sie was sagt sie",
		"ich trat mit anne lene in die reihe",
		"mir war als dürfe sie so nicht weiterreden",
		"erwiderte peters indem er der kleinen juliane die hand bot und sich mit ihr an die spitze der tanzkolonne stellte",
		"ei schöne mamsell sagte sie indem sie einen tiefen knicks vor ihr machte und mit einer abscheulichen koketterie ihre durchlöcherten röcke schwenkte haben sie keine angst meine lumpen sind alle gewaschen",
		"nach der sitte des landes die bei der schweren arbeit den leuten in jeder weise gestattet sich die brust zu lüften waren wir mit einem ganzen schauer von schimpf und neckworten überschüttet worden weder meine rote schülermütze noch meine damals allerdings ins kraut geschossene figur war verschont geblieben",
		"die schweren rinder welche wiederkäuend neben dem fußsteige lagen standen auf wenn wir vorübergingen und gaben uns das geleite bis zum nächsten heck mitunter in den trinkgruben erhob ein ochse seine breite stirn und brüllte weit in die landschaft hinaus",
		"anne lene und ich spielten unter dem tische zu ihren füßen wir legten den kopf auf den fußboden und horchten nach dem wasser hinunter",
		"anne lene ging schweigend und in sich verschlossen neben mir ihre gedanken mochten dort sein von wo ich sie so sehnlich zurückzurufen wünschte so waren wir bis zur graft hinabgekommen welche auch hier die grenze des eigentlichen hofes bildete",
		"o anne lene rief ich und trat auf die stufen die zu dem pavillon führten ich ich hole sie",
		"diese vorfälle welche damals bei der kurz danach erfolgten abreise des kammerjunkers bald von mir vergessen waren ließen nun nicht ab mich zu beunruhigen bis sie endlich von den leiden und freuden des studentenlebens aufs neue in den hintergrund gedrängt wurden",
		"aber anne lene",
		"so sagt sie endlich und atmet dabei aus herzensgrunde so nun bist du bald begraben",
		"sie hatte ihr gesicht zu mir gewandt und sah mich traurig an mitleidig ich weiß noch jetzt nicht ob mit mir oder mit sich selbst",
		"wir traten einander gegenüber und ich machte mein kompliment wie der tanzmeister es mich gelehrt hatte",
		"und mein verlangen mit ihr zu tanzen war so groß daß ich mir diese versicherung gefallen ließ",
		"aber sowie der alte die hand vom sattel ließ und seine geige unters kinn stützte rührte peters das pferd mit den sporen daß es ausschlug und der alte schwankte und griff wieder hastig nach dem sattel",
		"noch sehe ich sie vor mir die kleine leichte gestalt wie sie ruhig auf der schwelle stand den strohhut am bande in der hand hin und her schwenkend während die sonne auf das goldklare haar schien das ihr in kleinen locken um das köpfchen hing",
		"dann sagte sie langsam ich weiß es nicht das ist auch einerlei",
		"mir war als renne in meinem kopfe etwas davon das ich um jeden preis wieder einholen müßte wenn ich nicht wahnsinnig werden wollte",
		"der alte knurrte etwas vor sich hin aber er tat doch wie ihm geheißen und bald ritt peters im galopp zum tore hinaus",
		"wohin man sehen mochte zwischen den hohen sträuchern hing das gespinst der jungfernrebe über den mit gras bewachsenen steigen in den rot blühenden himbeerbüschen hatten die wespen ihre pappenen nester aufgehangen",
		"ich habe heute keine lust zu spielen",
		"ich befinde mich sehr wohl nur zuweilen stört mich ein krächzen das aus der ferne zu uns herüberdringt",
		"unwillkürlich schloß ich die hand des mädchens heftig in die meine doch mit der scheu die der jugend eigen sah ich in demselben augenblick zu boden",
		"rief peters allein er machte doch keinen versuch seine späße fortzusetzen und ließ es geschehen daß marten dem alten drees herunterhalf",
		"bald stand ich wieder auf dem abschüssigen uferrande und blickte ratlos über die graft entlang",
		"bring mir den braunen marten aber brauch deine beine",
		"im zimmer drinnen pflegte dann auf dem langen blank gescheuerten tische schon der kaffeekessel seinen duft zu verbreiten und die alte wieb wenn sie mir die hand gegeben und ihrem lieblingskinde die heißen haare von der stirn gestrichen hatte schenkte uns viele tassen ein so viele als wir immer trinken konnten und dann noch eine fürs nötigen wie sie sagte",
		"willst du nicht kommen marx",
		"rief er aber kratze nicht so es kommen feine leute an den tanz",
		"willst du mit mir tanzen",
		"es mag doch wohl anders gewesen sein wieb sagte sie traurig du mußt mich nicht belügen",
		"bald sitze ich in eine serviette geknüpft der kleinen anne lene gegenüber wieb steht dabei und serviert uns von den resten",
		"bald sah ich nichts mehr von allem was sich um uns her bewegte ich war allein mit ihr diese festen klingenden geigenstriche hatten uns von der welt geschieden sie lag verschollen unerreichbar weit dahinter",
		"denn mir ist als habe an jenen sonntagnachmittagen immer die sonne geschienen und als sei die luft über dieser endlosen grünen wiesenfläche immer voll von lerchengesang gewesen",
		"unter der schnur eines päckchens das auf ihrem schoße lag zog sie einen brief hervor sie entfaltete ihn und schien aufmerksam darin zu lesen",
		"dann sahen wir durch die erblindeten fensterscheiben nach dem zärtlichen schäferpaar hinüber das noch immer wie vor jahren auf der mitte der wand im grase kniete und rüttelten vergebens an den türen welche von der alten wieb sorgfältig verschlossen gehalten wurden denn der fußboden drinnen war unsicher geworden und hier und dort konnte man durch die ritzen in den dielen auf das darunter stehende wasser sehen",
		"hier waren wir auf unserm alten spielplatz es waren noch dieselben büsche zwischen denen wir einst als kinder in die irre gegangen waren nur hingen ihre zweige noch tiefer in den weg als damals",
		"ich bat meine alte freundin mir eine streu in ihrer stube aufzuschütten und schlenderte während dies geschah in den garten hinaus",
		"nimm dich in acht claus peters tanzt schon den zweiten tanz mit ihr",
		"es war schon spätnachmittags als ich den staatshof erreichte",
		"kind sagte sie besorgt der doktor hat s dir ja verboten",
		"die wenigen lichter konnten den weiten raum nicht erhellen aber draußen war schon der mond aufgegangen und schien durch die fenster und es war anmutig wie die blumenleuchte mitten in dem öden zimmer schwebte und wie der duft erregt wurde wenn die mädchen unten durch tanzten",
		"bald waren zwei holzleisten aufgefunden und kreuzweis",
		"die alte schien um worte verlegen",
		"bald war zwischen den höchsten ästen eine schaukel festgeknüpft und die mädchen wurden eingeladen sich hineinzusetzen",
		"gleich darauf waren alle oben im saal und nachdem peters dem alten musikanten seine angst durch einige gläser wein vergütet hatte setzte dieser sich auf ein kleines faß und begann seine stücke aufzustreichen",
		"damals aber hatten die kleinen tanzenden füße mein ganzes knabenherz verwirrt",
		"sorge nicht marx sagte sie indem sie hineintrat und ihre leichte gestalt auf den losen brettern wiegte",
		"der letzte männliche sprosse war als fünfzehnjähriger knabe auf eine gewaltsame weise ums leben gekommen auf der fenne eines benachbarten hofbesitzers hatte er ein einjähriges füllen ohne zaum und halfter bestiegen war dabei von dem scheuen tier in die trinkgrube gestürzt und ertrunken",
		"setz nur den kessel ans feuer wieb sagte ich ich will sie holen wir kommen bald zurück",
		"die streitenden rührten sich bei unsrer ankunft in ihrem eifer nicht von der stelle und da wir nach dem flur zwischen beiden hindurch mußten so nahm anne lene ihr kleid zusammen um nicht an das der bettlerin zu streifen",
