		"i thought with glee",
		"here then i was in the third storey fastened into one of its mystic cells night around me a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door yes that was appalling the rest i could bear but i shuddered at the thought of grace poole bursting out upon me",

		"the governess had run away two months before and for all mr rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the world he never could hear a word of her and he grew savage quite savage on his disappointment he never was a wild man but he got dangerous after he lost her",

		"yes very",

		"yes slaving amongst strangers",
		"a pit full of fire",

		"she is standing alone at the table bending gracefully over an album",
		"the readers of our era are less favoured",
		"it is not your place",
		"can i do anything",
		"you re not grown so very tall miss jane nor so very stout continued mrs leaven",
		"there sit down and think over your wickedness",
		"because i am comfortable there",
		"should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur such as the spoiling of a meal the under or the over dressing of a dish the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation",
		"she will want to warm herself what will she do for a fire",
		"we are now without father we shall soon be without home and brother she murmured",
		"yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency advertisements have been put in all the papers i myself have received a letter from one mr briggs a solicitor communicating the details i have just imparted",
		"but the three most distinguished partly perhaps because the tallest figures of the band were the dowager lady ingram and her daughters blanche and mary",
		"presently advanced into view miss ingram",
		"i did not like to put my hand into a hireling s but it is pleasant to feel it circled by jane s little fingers",
		"helen burns asked some slight question about her work of miss smith was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry returned to her place and smiled at me as she again went by",
		"nine years is a tolerable time",
		"they began to talk their conversation eased me completely frivolous mercenary heartless and senseless it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener",
		"it was easy to make my further arrangements for i was troubled with no inquiries no surmises",
		"i did so not at first aware what was his intention but when i saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it i instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm not soon enough however the volume was flung it hit me and i fell striking my head against the door and cutting it",
		"i found him at supper",
		"was that grace poole",
		"i have none",
		"it aroused him he uncrossed his legs sat erect turned to me",
		"an austere patriot s passion for his fatherland",
		"we stayed there nearly a week i and sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees called the park and there were many children there besides me and a pond with beautiful birds in it that i fed with crumbs",
		"is it her mr bates has been to see",
		"from every enjoyment i was of course excluded my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana and seeing them descend to the drawing room dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes with hair elaborately ringletted and afterwards in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing room door opened and closed",
		"it is a long way i again said",
		"diana then turned to me",
		"i pass over the madness about parting from me",
		"i was no vocalist myself and in his fastidious judgment no musician either but i delighted in listening when the performance was good",
		"this wound was not done with a knife there have been teeth here",
		"i do not speak to the feeble or think of them i address only such as are worthy of the work and competent to accomplish it",
		"all shall bolt out at once like the bullet from the barrel",
		"i had nowhere seen such faces as theirs and yet as i gazed on them i seemed intimate with every lineament",
		"mr rochester took it leaving room however for me but i stood before him",
		"you",
		"you need be in no hurry to hear he said let me frankly tell you i have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest",
		"the solo over a duet followed and then a glee a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals",
		"the carrier no doubt i thought and ran downstairs without inquiry",
		"the stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere the curtains were yet drawn over the servants chamber windows little birds were just twittering in the blossom blanched orchard trees whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables all else was still",
		"it is from the master said she as she looked at the direction",
		"a neighbour or two came in my chair was evidently wanted",
		"the month of courtship had wasted its very last hours were being numbered",
		"in the deep shade at the farther end of the room a figure ran backwards and forwards",
		"yes coming down hill it slipped on some ice",
		"are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter of the new life into which you are passing",
		"i sat down quite disembarrassed",
		"good night again sir",
		"because i was poor and burdensome and she disliked me",
		"what a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon",
		"he would send for me in the morning i should be gone",
		"oh that i had been with you",
		"she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others",
		"i am only ashamed of his asking so little and they must marry",
		"i have certainly meant well through the whole affair",
		"i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia",
		"but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us",
		"who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire",
		"mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them",
		"his brother in law mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year",
		"my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of",
		"in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house",
		"elizabeth was in agonies",
		"the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father",
		"i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me",
		"i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so",
		"now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence for the liveliness of your mind i did you may as well call it impertinence at once",
		"the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter",
		"she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her",
		"mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton",
		"it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed",
		"and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information",
		"when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain",
		"good gracious",
		"on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery",
		"that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it",
		"your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight",
		"it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family",
		"oh",
		"but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them",
		"there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what",
		"to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating",
		"jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news what news",
		"i am afraid you will be angry my dearest sister now be serious",
		"the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten",
		"if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer",
		"instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt",
		"and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything",
		"i cannot understand it",
		"mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire",
		"one came from her books and the other from her toilette",
		"he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me",
		"it would be dreadful",
		"did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations",
		"the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished",
		"how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls",
		"were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion",
		"a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away",
		"an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all",
		"nonsense how can you talk so",
		"she is quite a little creature",
		"mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalf s calling yesterday to thank me",
		"now is your time",
		"it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy",
		"three daughters married",
		"if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful",
		"it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting",
		"the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again",
		"at length with a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting",
		"the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt",
		"they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham",
		"but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance",
		"mrs gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly",
		"as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of",
		"mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education",
		"it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country",
		"i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent",
		"not at all",
		"your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you",
		"you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together",
		"but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design",
		"it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to",
		"since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy",
		"they came",
		"could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes",
		"what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here",
		"yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care",
		"the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it",
		"attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham",
		"but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away",
		"she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent",
		"it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess",
		"tis an etiquette i despise said he",
		"and his answering immediately to the last question oh",
		"a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh that my dear mother had more command over herself",
		"when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away",
		"lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone",
		"her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies",
		"there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others",
		"you must contrive to send somebody",
		"what i have to say relates to poor lydia",
		"it is of no consequence",
		"he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence",
		"elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me",
		"it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter",
		"its completion depended on others",
		"his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars",
		"the tete a tete surprised them",
		"but that is not the case here",
		"elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship",
		"it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return",
		"he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech",
		"you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude",
		"and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves",
		"i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins s character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family",
		"but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country",
		"a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility",
		"my temper would perhaps be called resentful",
		"his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others",
		"i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage",
		"to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add",
		"she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over",
		"mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well",
		"i dearly love a laugh miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be",
		"having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity",
		"why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight",
		"not these two or three years perhaps write to me very often my dear as often as i can",
		"but that is nothing to us",
		"her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome",
		"her hair so untidy so blowsy yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me",
		"have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is",
		"to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected",
		"if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning",
		"miss bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself",
		"kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy",
		"but now we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes",
		"mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home",
		"how could i be so silly as to wish it",
		"i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner",
		"on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet answered instantly oh dear yes certainly",
		"our poor mother is sadly grieved",
		"jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them",
		"she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man",
		"every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight",
		"nothing could console and nothing could appease her",
		"as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner",

		"jane dinwoodie and mary dickey could well remember the day she was brought into the district school her mutinous black eyes gleaming under a shock of rough hair her clumsy little apron tripping her with its unaccustomed strings",
		"you can you can let me off being photographed like a sweet child",
		"altogether cornelia s life was quite perfect well ordered harmonious and beautiful",
		"have your breakfast and then come to the box office i ll leave a seat for you there",
		"jim",
		"between pure milk and politics and charities and luncheons it s just too much",
		"she went on with bitter emphasis",
		"well",
		"honestly i didn t",
		"i get hot you know i don t mean anything",
		"it suddenly swept over her with a thankfulness too deep for realization that this would be her world",
		"the old woman shook with laughter",
		"and what have you to do now dear",
		"general ople winced",
		"and at least it implies wealth",
		"ah",
		"what will cover you",
		"comfort fortification and gentlemanliness made the place as the general said an ideal english home",
		"he wisely decided to retain the old couple at the lodge whose members were used to restriction and also not to purchase a cow that would have wanted pasture",
		"i was saying i",
		"would they have allowed her to see that she could sting them",
		"lady camper came to his gate unexpectedly rang the bell and was let in like an ordinary visitor",
		"i i i never know when i am not looking a fool",
		"she was wealthy",
		"a rakish husband for example for reginald is young and no one can guess what will be made of him",
		"do not be hurt if i decide that we had better remain as we are",
		"it may be seen that he was of an adventurous temperament though he had thought fit to loosen his sword belt",
		"now listen to me and do not exclaim until i have finished",
		"if you have not much money to spare for her according to your prudent calculation reflect how this money has enfeebled you and reduced you to the level of the people round about us here who are what",
		"the general collected himself",
		"she shall be she will dear madam",
		"during the sermon a low voice sharp in contradistinction to the monotone of the preacher s was heard to repeat these words i say i am not sure i shall survive it",
		"but he was a general officer of not more than fifty five in his full vigour and she a woman of seventy",
		"my aunt angela was the handsomest woman of her time",
		"lady camper surprised him by answering his thoughts",
		"he was absent an hour and a half",
		"the officer within says i say i should be very happy to carry it but i cannot quit this gentlemanly residence",
		"he saw that the young man and elizabeth were mortally pale and as the very idea of wretchedness directed his attention to himself he addressed them conjointly on the subject of his persecution giving neither of them a chance of speaking until they were constrained to part",
		"she asked him what is your objection to colours",
		"but hardly had he escaped before he had a desire for the renewal of the operation",
		"an ordinary calculation would give me twenty good years to come",
		"general ople entered into the gaieties of the neighbourhood once more and passed through the winter cheerfully",
		"and there you see this is what she has done",
		"young rolles whom he had met now and then persisted in praising his aunt s good heart",
		"lady camper sent in her card",
		"he touched his throat",
		"she laid such stress on her remark that the general who had just expressed a very modest estimate of his abilities was unable to reject the flattery of her assuming him to be a man of some fortune",
		"he was pained to think of her misfortune but as she was not over forty the disaster was perhaps not irremediable that is to say if she could be taught to extend her forgiveness to men and abandon her solitude",
		"then will you do me the favour to reply to me",
		"the subject was disagreeable to a man sensitive on the topic of money and feeling that his prudence had recently been misled to keep up appearances",
		"the first sketch had merely seemed picturesque and he supposed it a clever play of fancy by some travelling friend or perhaps an actual scene slightly exaggerated",
		"general ople delivered his card at lady camper s lodgegates and escaped to his residence in a state of prickly heat that required the brushing of his hair with hard brushes for several minutes to comfort and re establish him",
		"and now we shall see what the two birds will do",
		"and as a crutch general ople parading her grounds with the aged woman found himself used and treated",
		"do you expect that i should be the person to settle money on your daughter to save her from mischances",
		"and she is an ardent soldier and a soldier she must marry",
		"she tested the resources of his income by all sorts of instigation to expenditure which his gallantry could not withstand she encouraged him to talk of his deeds in arms she was friendly almost affectionate and most bountiful in the presents of fruit peaches nectarines grapes and hot house wonders that she showered on his table but she was an enigma in her evident dissatisfaction with him for something he seemed to have left unsaid",
		"he had to wait a fortnight before one came and that was rather a likeness and a handsome likeness except as regarded a certain disorderliness in his dress which he knew to be very unlike him",
		"he made a sort of slipping dance back for his hat and followed her ladyship",
		"by express arrangement the card of general wilson ople as her nearest neighbour followed the card of the rector the social head of the district and the rector was granted an interview but lady camper was not at home to general ople",
		"the general consulted with his daughter and came to the conclusion that as he could hardly despatch a written reply to a verbal message yet greatly wished to subscribe to the wishes of lady camper the best thing for him to do was to apply for an interview",
		"i could not come to her empty handed",
		"still it despatched him to the looking glass to bring that verifier of facts in evidence against the sketch",
		"my dear lady",
		"you know that these two young ones have been whispering over the wall for some months",
		"so should she general so should elizabeth",
		"what else can i do child",
		"he could remember only the gentlemanly residence",
		"fearful of not being understood owing to the rarity of the occasions when the squat plain squad of honest saxon regulars at his command were called upon to explain an idea he re cast the sentence",
		"he would have to speak of his income",
		"lady camper leaned with some pressure on his arm observing you have a curious attachment to antiquities",
		"no added lady camper it is no triumph for me but it is one for you if you like to make the most of it",
		"least of all one who has entered into relations with an eccentric lady",
		"he addresses her as his neighbour and tells her of his triumphs over the sex",
		"i am rather nervous to day i forgot elizabeth he said sending his fingers in a dotting run of wonderment round his neck",
		"he would fain have run away",
		"it resembled an outlook on the steppes",
		"hard exercise is the best of opiates for dismal reflections",
		"her mouth had a charm her eyes were lively her figure mature if you like was at least full and good she stood upright she had a queenly seat",
		"consult your happiness she answered and if to his mind she seemed returning to the state of enigma it was on the whole deliciously",
		"and no apologies if you please i like you well enough as you are",
		"he glanced at it and round about and again at it and at the heavens",
		"i say i could not allow ladies to see it he informed the gentlemen who were suffered to inspect it freely",
		"his hope was that no one would mention lady camper s name for the mere thought of her caused a rush to his head",
		"lady camper remarked of her she seems honest and that is the most we can hope of girls",
		"i am speaking of these young people general ople",
		"i am impatient yes general impatient for what forgiveness",
		"the great lady stood a moment beside mrs baerens she came straight over to him contemplating him in silence",
		"very hot as you say madam i do not complain of pen and ink but i would rather escape colours",
		"as for the men they knew him to have faced the balls in bellowing battle strife they knew him to have endured privation not only cold but downright want of food and drink an almost unimaginable horror to these brave daily feasters so they could not quite look on him in contempt but his want of sense was offensive and still more so his submission to a scourging by a woman",
		"on the other hand for the protection of the sex a remainder of shyness kept him from active enterprise and in the state of suffering so long as indications of encouragement were wanting",
		"but you see i have no means of escape i am at her mercy from morning to night the general said with a quivering tongue unless i stay at home inside the house and that is death to me or unless i abandon the place and my lease and i shall i say i shall find nowhere in england for anything like the money or conveniences such a gent a residence you would call fit for a gentleman",
		"yet said the general girls expect to marry",
		"to the death madam said the general",
		"i have little to offer myself",
		"he decided from his experience of her",
		"he drew forth his pocket book handed her the latest and remarked on the gross injustice of it for as he requested them to take note her ladyship now sketched him as a person inattentive to his dress and he begged them to observe that she had drawn him with his necktie hanging loose",
		"he fell upon the wych elm with his own hands under cover of the leafage and the next day he paid his respects to lady camper to inquire if her ladyship saw any further obstruction to the view",
		"you are ten times the man in exercise",
		"general ople met him outside his gates received and returned a polite salute liked his appearance and manners and talked of him to elizabeth asking her if by chance she had seen him",
		"this in an engagement with a clever woman is what you should do or else you are likely to find yourself planted unawares in a high wind your hat blown off and your coat tails anywhere in other words you will stand ridiculous in your bewilderment and general ople ever footed with the utmost caution to avoid that quagmire of the ridiculous",
		"no it really was true curiously true another lady s eye might have transformed him to a pumpkin shape exaggerated all his foibles fifty fold and he though not liking it of course not would yet have preserved a certain manly equanimity",
		"now we learn from those who have studied women on the chess board and know what ebony or ivory will do along particular lines or hopping that men much talked about will take possession of their thoughts and certainly the fact may be accepted for one of their moves",
		"he prepared to listen to her with a disconnected smile of acute attentiveness",
		"he hastens past her window on foot with his head bent just as the general had been in the habit of walking",
		"she has every quality of a good wife",
		"she remarked simply enough that it was her nephew s habit to take early gallops and possibly elizabeth might have seen him for his quarters were proximate but she did not demand an answer",
		"the general inquired anxiously a little a little afraid of her",
		"these prompting speeches occurred on the morning of the day when elizabeth sat at his table after a long ride into the country profoundly meditative",
		"now you would never think of pretending to a moral quality you do not possess",
		"it would demand perpetual vigilance hop skip jump flounderings and apologies",
		"how was it lady camper had such power over him a lady concealing seventy years with a rouge box or paint pot",
		"not a soul met them down the lanes except a little one to whom lady camper gave a small silver piece because she was a picture",
		"she teaches them nothing when they are whirling",
		"he knew he was captivating his old conquests whispered in his ears and her reception of him all but pointed to a footstool at her feet",
		"is she alone",
		"they would have laughed at her",
		"the verified absence of necktie and collar seemed to be choking him",
		"i wish you success",
		"her countenance was inexorably imperturbable under his alternate blinking and gazing that drew her close and shot her distant like a mysterious toy",
		"the general discomposed his daughter by offering to accompany her on her morning ride before breakfast",
		"the general tried again he could not utter the name",
		"my road he answered gallantly is forward",
		"said he",
		"well they have a certain excuse for selfishness we have not",
		"he himself had an uncomfortable confession to make",
		"she considered that it would fatigue him",
		"she replied i would not deprive you of a moment of happiness",
		"yes i have finer health than many a younger woman she said",
		"do you hear",
		"i shall not like to lose her you would not wish it",
		"lady camper s return was the subject of speculation in the neighbourhood for most people thought she would cease to persecute the general with her preposterous and unwarrantable pen and ink sketches when living so closely proximate and how he would behave was the question",
		"of course there was no choice but to surrender on the spot",
		"i prefer quiet and retirement",
		"the sum of his impressions was conveyed in the reflective utterance it only shows my dear how different the reality is from our anticipation of it",
		"his shuddering sensitiveness to caricature was increased by a certain evident dread of the hand which struck the knowing that he was absolutely bare to this woman defenceless open to exposure in his little whims foibles tricks incompetencies in what lay in his heart and the words that would come to his tongue",
		"fetch her in my carriage",
		"so you know it papa if she should speak of it",
		"why then was the terrible test brought to bear upon him of all men",
		"lady camper s brows showed a trifling bewilderment",
		"she signified to them that they were to sit then quietly took her seat among them fronting the general across the aisle",
		"young rolles offered to expostulate with his aunt angela",
		"and to prove it to you i was glad to take this house when i knew i was to have a gallant gentleman for a neighbour",
		"in time when his own imagination instigated by a state of something more than mere contentment had been at work on it he chose the happy phrase a gentlemanly residence",
		"the house for who can hope and who should desire a commodious house with conservatories aviaries pond and boat shed and other joys of wealth to remain unoccupied was taken two seasons later by a lady of whom fame rolling like a dust cloud from the place she had left reported that she was eccentric",
		"but between watching an orb that is only variable at our caprice and contemplating a woman who shifts and quivers ever with her own how vast the difference",
		"and reflect whether you have not been intoxicated for these young people have been wretched and you have not observed it though one of them was living with you and is the child you love",
		"but like you i am happy to say i have not a malady",
		"he turned back to her to kiss her again",
		"she rose bowed to him good morning general and turned her back",
		"he had passed into his hat and out of it which he habitually did standing when who should walk up to within a couple of yards of him but lady camper",
		"he was drawing backward as he said it and something provoked her to smile",
		"he had not thought of ascribing the acuteness of his pain to the miserable image he presented in this particular lady s eye",
		"the pony carriage however had been hired for the very special purpose of helping him to pass in review the lines of what he called country houses cottages or even sites for building not too remote from sweet london and as when coelebs goes forth intending to pursue and obtain there is no doubt of his bringing home a wife the circumstance that there stood a house to let in an airy situation at a certain distance in hail of the metropolis he worshipped was enough to kindle the general s enthusiasm",
		"several of the shadows are prostrate",
		"alas",
		"true i would rather have had him at call but as i have always wished for a policeman in the house i may as well be satisfied with a soldier",
		"let us hope it will be a distant day",
		"perhaps i may be of some aid to you",
		"general ople i forbid you as you value my esteem ever and i repeat i forbid you ever to afflict my ears with that phrase lady friend",
		"you must get a militia regiment or inspectorship of militia",
		"so the deduction was obvious that lady camper had reduced him",
		"elizabeth ople beheld a tall handsomely mannered lady with good features and penetrating dark eyes an easy carriage of her person and an agreeable voice but the vision of her age flashed out under the compelling eyes of youth fifty if a day",
		"my income",
		"she had passed a rather restless night she said",
		"at all hours",
		"you are very kind to fall in with the deception an innocent and i think a proper one before the world though not to the gentleman who does me the honour to propose to me for my hand",
		"instead of handing back the card to the maid he stuck it in his hat and went on digging",
		"ah cried lady camper do not use these vulgar contractions of decent speech in my presence",
		"they have imposed on you",
		"come said she and he shot forward a step looking as if he had missed fire",
		"to lady camper s eye",
		"lady camper talked with her through the bars",
		"holden steadying himself against the wall leaned in a window on the other side of the shack and emptied his colt in a dazed manner doing his very best",
		"partners were chosen the women wearing handkerchiefs on their arms to indicate the fact and the room shook and quivered as the scraping of heavy boots filled the air with a cloud of dust",
		"harlan was the proprietor and bartender of the oasis and catered to the excessive and uncritical thirsts of the ruck of range society and he had objected vigorously to the placing of the second sign in his place of business but at the close of an incisive if inelegant reply from the marshal the sign went up and stayed up",
		"if i can lead him out of his wickedness i will rest content though i save no more souls this fortnight",
		"how about them wedges twenty five cents a pound explained the clerk groping for his bearings",
		"yes hopalong replied coolly appraising harlan s attitude and look in one swift glance but it ain t here now",
		"such was cowan s the best patronized place in many hot and dusty miles and the mecca of the cowboys from the surrounding ranches",
		"little wide at the sharp end",
		"he rounded big bend as if he were coming up to the judge s stand and when he struck the upslant of the emerging trail he had made a record",
		"hey hoppy",
		"about a week after the finding of the first skinned cows pete wilson tornadoed up to the bunk house with a perforated arm",
		"but red had cultivated the habit of thinking quickly and he saw at once that the remedy lay with him he astonished the exultant savages by straddling his disgruntled horse as it scrambled to its feet and galloping away from them bearing slightly to the south because he wished to lure his pursuers to ride closer to his anxious and eager friend",
		"red deftly knocked his companion s iron up and spoke sharply",
		"good",
		"three of em chased me an the two that are left are coming hot foot somewhere the other side of them hills",
		"he wasn t drunk he muttered",
		"you can t fool old john even if he is getting old",
		"yore gall is refreshing",
		"they re bluffing that s all i don t think they are an there s twelve men in that outfit suggested the stranger offhand",
		"yo re right harper",
		"ah did you say twenty five dollars he snapped leveling an accusing and threatening fore finger at the man nearest him who squirmed restlessly and glanced at the stranger",
		"it didn t take much of a loss to wipe out a day s profits with him",
		"but say if only we had our guns he sighed regretfully",
		"old john s mouth dropped open as he beheld his habitually indolent host marking off long distances on the sand with each falling foot",
		"when the crowd massed hopalong leaped at it and strove to tear his way to the opening at the end of the bar while the marshal covered harlan and the others",
		"quinn here met joe barr of the c who said converse an four other fellers all friends of edwards stopped at the ranch an won t be back home till the storm stops",
		"harlan stopped his pacing and faced them shoving out a bottle of whiskey as an aid to his logic",
		"an i m sorry you got that eye dent oh that s all right hastily assured the store keeper smiling faintly",
		"we ll all help you as soon as the wranglers bring us up something to ride",
		"others had seen that ghost but they were all mexicans now that a white man of johnny s undisputed calibre had been so honored dent s skepticism wavered and he had something to think about for days to come",
		"hey johnny exclaimed smiling faintly in his misery",
		"an all the gospel sharps south of heaven can t stop me from handing a thief what he s earned",
		"as he faced the rear a horseman rounded the turn and the fugitive wheeling dashed for the stolen horse forty yards away where his rifle lay in its saddle sheath",
		"i m going to graze loose an buck jump all i wants",
		"i am going to do that same thing an prove that you are a pack of fools",
		"you blow yoreself up any more n i ll bust you wide open heaving up with all his might on the free end of the strap one knee pushing against the animal s side",
		"but to night it was dark and the bummer gained his coveted goal with ridiculous ease after which he started right in to work off the high pressure of the energy he had accumulated during the last two nights",
		"an the worst part of the whole thing is that i ain t got no gun an can t seem to borrow none neither he added wistfully eyeing the stranger s colt",
		"i ve knowed him too long an well to believe that gambling had anything to do with it",
		"i ve seen that there feller som ers sometime he whispered",
		"not a plugged peso well as i said before i don t want to fight nobody less i has to replied cranky joe",
		"they could picture it vividly in all its devilish horror",
		"i know i ve doubted it but who wouldn t",
		"they ll canter right in like they allus do an when they get close enough we ll open the game with a volley an make every shot tell",
		"i ain t so very much taken with it but i know i would be if i knowed i couldn t have any yes that s human nature all right laughed lucas",
		"he ain t got sand enough to tackle a thing like that single handed laughed jed white winking to the others",
		"now look here stranger noon is only two hours away an i m due to lose my outfit what are you going to do to get me out of this mess he finished anxiously hands on hips",
		"got the money with you what yelled fisher emerging from his trance",
		"ye re irish by the way av ye and t is back to town ye go sor he turned to the crew stand by me boys and in a short time the course was nor by nor west",
		"so as long as you don t lose nothing you ain t got no kick coming have you",

		"if you shoot me down without giving me a chance all right",
		"he was very glad indeed that he had been so grievously misinformed about the personal attributes of one hopalong cassidy glad and thankful",
		"what yelled harlan red with anger",

		"get out of my way i m next boggs listened intently and then pushed duke lane back",
		"you ve been used but that don t make no difference searching further he opened a full box of machetes and soon after found cartridges of many kinds and calibres",
		"that s all of it take it or leave it",
		"thank the lord i ain t got no use for shell games of any kind",
		"stop it shut up",
		"now remarked fisher watching his money disappear into the bartender s pocket i ll put up my gun agin ten of yore dollars if yo re game",
		"he appeared to be excited and unduly heated if one might judge from his words and voice",
		"this number compared very favorably with that of the second chute where lanky smith and frenchy mcalister waved cold irons and sarcastically asked their iron men if the sun was supposed to provide the heat whereat the down trodden heaters provided heat with great generosity in their caustic retorts",
		"i had to look twice to be shore it was him",
		"now you coyotes you pay me for that he gritted resting the gun on the window sill and holding it so he could work it with one hand and shoulder",
		"the bartender returned with several men at his heels and all were grinning and joking",
		"then mebby i can get a drink chuckled larkin brightening under the thought",
		"an i reckon we ve treed him judging from the tracks and if you capture him he won t have no more use for no side pocket shooting i see you will kill him shore s it s wet outside i m afraid you are doomed to disappointment ya as asked red with a rising inflection",
		"shut up",
		"and what joy would be his when they were forced to surrender",
		"you shore ought to meet cassidy he s a fine man remarked lucas with enthusiasm",
		"it s first class the bartender walked to the door looked carefully around for a moment his eyes fastening upon a trail in the sandy street",

		"put him in the boat an mind ye handle him gintly we ll be sailing under him soon",
		"then two shots rang out in quick succession and a cloud of pungent smoke arose lazily from the edge of the arroyo as the warriors fell from their mounts not sixty yards from the hidden marksman",
		"is it all true huh",
		"hear that",
		"only scratches an sore heads responded hopalong smiling",
		"that it was the ghost of carlos martinez murdered nearly one hundred years before at the big bend in the canyon was conceded by all but there was a dispute as to why it showed itself only on friday nights and why it was never seen by any but a mexican",
		"from the shadows along the side walls other figures silently emerged and grouped around the coffin",
		"friend he said addressing the bartender how is it that this sort of thing can go on in this town when the bartender had explained at some length his interested listener smote the bar with a heavy fist and voiced his outraged feelings",
		"an unearthly piercing shriek suddenly rang out and filled the canyon with ear splitting uproar and a glowing sheeted half figure of a man floated and danced twenty feet from him and over the chasm",
		"the stranger dragged himself to the canteens and drank what little water remained and then turned to watch the two men moving from place to place firing coolly and methodically",
		"r a t s it shows itself only to greasers an then only on friday nights explained dent thoughtfully",
		"i ll stop at cowan s an have him send word to lucas an bartlett so there ll be enough in case any of our boys are out on the range in some line house",
		"suppose one of my men had been killed at the fence what then well what do you want me to do stop this foolishness an take down them fences for a mile each side of the trail",

		"i d be a fine sort of a coyote to leave him in that hell hole an not go back wouldn t i he said with quiet determination",
		"huh",
		"it s through that other fence by now",
		"they knew what he had looked upon for they themselves had become familiar with the work of apaches in arizona",
		"the merits of their respective rifles had always been a bone of contention between them and one well chewed at that",
		"red raised one hand as he carefully traced a neck to its own proper head and then his steel fingers opened and swooped down and shut off the dialect",
		"elkins had stumbled here but there were no toe marks to tell of it",
		"leave me some of yore colt cartridges though",
		"fun is fun but it s getting a little too serious for comfort sometime after the middle of the second shift the herd already irritable nervous and cranky because of the thirst they were enduring and worked up to the fever pitch by the devilish manoeuvres of the exuberant and hard working bummer wanted only the flimsiest kind of an excuse to stampede and they might go without an excuse",
		"stick yore hat out cranky an see what you can do he suggested irritably",
		"the liquor he had once been in the habit of consuming had been reduced to a negligible quantity he spent the money on cartridges instead and his pistol work showed the results of careful and dogged practice particularly in the quickness of the draw",
		"the animal was a good one a successful contender in all distances from one to five miles and had earned its owner and backers much money and hopalong had parted with it as easily as he would have borrowed five dollars from red",
		"he hasn t opened his mouth",
		"damn you",
		"an i say right here an now that i won t allow no spavined individual with thieving prehensils to has that pound keeper got a rifle calmly interrupted the stranger without a pang of remorse",
		"then he glanced at the man in the door a puzzled expression stealing over his face",
		"there was only one horse in the enclosure where the night before there had been four",
		"jackson grabbed a can of corn as it jarred off the shelf behind him and directed a pleasing phrase after the peevish barr",
		"where s the marshal cried barr catching sight of jackson",
		"don t make no noise doing it neither if you can help it",
		"did did i get him no but he gimleted you all right hopalong replied",
		"i ll bet they gave him a cayuse an started him off while we ve been losing time in here",
		"what s this demanded the newcomer angrily",
		"i ain t never seen none of that breed what ever left a town without empty pockets an aching heads an the smarter they think they are the easier they fall a fleeting expression of discontent clouded the smile for the lure of the open range is hard to resist when once a man has ridden free under its sky and watched its stars",
		"the majority had simply sawed off a generous part of the long barrels of their colts and remingtons which did not improve their accuracy",
		"that s flat he began to talk feverishly to gain time and his eyes lighted suddenly",
		"he comes to life real sudden when he s shoved",
		"hand grenades",
		"did you look all over",
		"there would be no gauntlet found at the big bend at daylight",
		"this is fence country they regarded the speaker s smiling face and twinkling eyes and laughed",
		"now for the cartridges there shore must be some to go with these guns he saw a keg marked nails and managed to open it after great labor and found it full of army colts",
		"run for yore life",
		"he glanced about him to make sure of his bearings and then struck on a curving line for the river",
		"why don t you show some interest you dod blasted thick skulled wooden heads red looked at hopalong hopalong looked at red and then they both looked at dent whose eyes were fixed in a stare on johnny",
		"thus the peons complained to the padre while they kept one eye open for the advent of the rowdy cow punchers who always wanted to drink and then to fight with some one either with fists or pistols",
		"times were very dull on the ranch and this was an occasion far too precious to let slip by",
		"whiskey hazarded barr",
		"hey joe we need some more boxes he exclaimed again looking at his arm",
		"both he and barr were working like mad men moving boxes and barrels against the walls to make a breastwork capable of stopping the bullets which came through the boards",
		"never in all his life had minutes been so precious",
		"can t run knee cap s busted",
		"what you doing he shouted",
		"an he left his own critter behind because he knowed it wasn t no good",
		"an i want a hole in it too ain t you got no sense would i be up here if i had it s going to be hot as blazes up here when the sun gets high cheerfully prophesied tim an dry too he added for a finishing touch",
		"an i ll take yore winchester as a fine for this high handed business you ve been carrying on",
		"we re caught in yore trap an we ll fight to a finish",
		"but you come an see us when you can it s me that wants revenge this time huh you ll be wanting it worse than ever if we do smiled dave",
		"didn t you see no more n one ghost",
		"submission was not to be thought of for to flee would be to lose caste and the story of such an act would follow them wherever they went and brand them as cowards",
		"an you better gimme back that gun too take yore old gun who wants the blamed thing anyhow hopalong demanded throwing the weapon at his friend as he ran to bring up the hidden horse",
		"well we won t argue i m too tired",
		"why they re quite hocus pocus",

		"when words are sought by which to stigmatize the most odious despotism exercised in the most odious manner and all other comparisons are found inadequate the despots are said to be like slave masters or slave drivers",
		"and it has been an additional misfortune that some of our most powerful journals have been for many years past very unfavorable exponents of english feeling on all subjects connected with slavery some probably from the influences more or less direct of west indian opinions and interests others from inbred toryism which even when compelled by reason to hold opinions favorable to liberty is always adverse to it in feeling which likes the spectacle of irresponsible power exercised by one person over others which has no moral repugnance to the thought of human beings born to the penal servitude for life to which for the term of a few years we sentence our most hardened criminals but keeps its indignation to be expended on rabid and fanatical abolitionists across the atlantic and on those writers in england who attach a sufficiently serious meaning to their christian professions to consider a fight against slavery as a fight for god",

		"the moment a president was elected of whom it was inferred from his opinions not that he would take any measures against slavery where it exists but that he would oppose its establishment where it exists not that moment they broke loose from what was at least a very solemn contract and formed themselves into a confederation professing as its fundamental principle not merely the perpetuation but the indefinite extension of slavery",
		"their right to separate is the right which cartouche or turpin would have had to secede from their respective countries because the laws of those countries would not suffer them to rob and murder on the highway",

		"they may in the end be wearied into recognizing the separation",
		"compared with that the one in force at the time of the secession was a free trade tariff this latter was the result of several successive modifications in the direction of freedom and its principle was not protection for protection but as much of it only as might incidentally result from duties imposed for revenue",
		"the fear has not been realized that the only two first rate powers who are also free nations would take to tearing each other in pieces both the one and the other in a bad and odious cause",
		"this is carrying the doctrine of the sacred right of insurrection rather far",
		"as long as they were allowed to direct all the policy of the union to break through compromise after compromise encroach step after step until they reached the pitch of claiming a right to carry slave property into the free states and in opposition to the laws of those states hold it as property there so long they were willing to remain in the union",
		"but it is said the north will never succeed in conquering the south and since the separation must in the end be recognized it is better to do at first what must be done at last moreover if it did conquer them it could not govern them when conquered consistently with free institutions",

		"yet the tariff of that day was rigidly protective",
		"i am not blind to the possibility that it may require a long war to lower the arrogance and tame the aggressive ambition of the slave owners to the point of either returning to the union or consenting to remain out of it with their present limits",
		"war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war is worse",
		"the preservation of the union is an object about which the north are agreed and it has many adherents as they believe in the south generally",
		"have they ever considered what would have been the meaning of separation if it had been assented to by the northern states when first demanded",

		"and first it is necessary to ask have the slaves been consulted",
		"we expected that the atonement if atonement there were would have been made with reservations perhaps under protest",
		"but we are told by a strange misapplication of a true principle that the south had a right to separate that their separation ought to have been consented to the moment they showed themselves ready to fight for it and that the north in resisting it are committing the same error and wrong which england committed in opposing the original separation of the thirteen colonies",

		"as it is necessary to be prepared for all possibilities let us now contemplate another",
		"let me in a few words remind the reader what sort of a thing this is which the white oligarchy of the south have banded themselves together to propagate and establish if they could universally",
		"it is not probable that they would be willing to fight directly against slavery",
		"the slave owners know this and it is the cause of their fury",
		"they are ready on the contrary to give it new guarantees to renounce all that they have been contending for to win back if opportunity offers the south to the union by surrendering the whole point",
		"but this institution is the only one of them all which requires to keep it going that human beings should be burnt alive",

		"are we to see with indifference its victorious army let loose to propagate their national faith at the rifle s mouth through mexico and central america",
		"to slavery therefore it is a matter of life and death to find fresh fields for the employment of slave labor",
		"the calm and dispassionate mr olmsted affirms that there has not been a single year for many years past in which this horror is not known to have been perpetrated in some part or other of the south",
		"the president in his message has already proposed that this salutary reform should be effected in the case of maryland additional territory detached from virginia being given to that state as an equivalent thus clearly indicating the policy which he approves and which he is probably willing to make universal",
		"for these reasons i cannot join with those who cry peace peace",
		"i do not forget one regrettable passage in mr seward s letter in which he said that if the safety of the union required the detention of the captured persons it would be the right and duty of this government to detain them",
		"at all events no nation which has ever passed laws of exception which ever suspended the habeas corpus act or passed an alien bill in dread of a chartist insurrection has a right to throw the first stone at mr lincoln s government",

		"it will require a succession of humiliation to bring them to that",
		"should that time come not only will the greatest enormity which still exists among mankind as an institution receive far earlier its coups de grâce than there has ever until now appeared any probability of but in effecting this the free states will have raised themselves to that elevated position in the scale of morality and dignity which is derived from great sacrifices consciously made in a virtuous cause and the sense of an inestimable benefit to all future ages brought about by their own voluntary efforts",
		"when a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets in the service and for the selfish purposes of a master such war degrades a people",
		"it is hardly worth while to ask how far these explosions of ill humor are anything more than might have been anticipated from ill disciplined minds disappointed of the sympathy which they justly thought they had a right to expect from the great anti slavery people in their really noble enterprise",
		"it is almost superfluous to remark that a democratic government always shows worst where other governments generally show best on its outside that unreasonable people are much more noisy than the reasonable that the froth and scum are the part of a violently fermenting liquid that meets the eyes but are not its body and substance",
		"but the position which they occupy and the abstract excellence of which they are in arms to vindicate is that which the united voice of mankind habitually selects as the type of all hateful qualities",

		"that nearly half the population of the border slave states are in favor of it is a patent fact since they are now fighting in its defence",
		"when we are in the act of sending an expedition against mexico to redress the wrongs of private british subjects we should do well to reflect in time that the president of the new republic mr jefferson davis was the original inventor of repudiation",
		"mr lincoln has done what depended on him to make this spirit expire with the occasion which raised it up and we shall have ourselves chiefly to blame if we keep it alive by the further prolongation of that stream of vituperative eloquence the source of which even now when the cause of quarrel has been amicably made up does not seem to have run dry",
		"there are people who tell us that on the side of the north the question is not one of slavery at all",
		"if they have not taken arms against slavery they have against its extension",
		"the most ordinary policy teaches them to inscribe on their banner that part only of their known principles in which their supporters are unanimous",
		"if this knowledge does not come to them for several years the abolition question will by that time have settled itself",
		"but war in a good cause is not the greatest evil which a nation can suffer",
		"there is a theory in england believed perhaps by some half believed by many more which is only consistent with original ignorance or complete subsequent forgetfulness of all the antecedents of the contest",
		"whether or not the northern americans will succeed in reconquering the south i do not affect to foresee",
		"we shall soon have causes enough of quarrel on our own account",
		"it may be assumed that in that event the victorious party would make the alterations in the federal constitution which are necessary to adapt it to the new circumstances and which would not infringe but strengthen its democratic principles",
		"it would also be right to abrogate that bad provision of the constitution a necessary compromise at the time of its first establishment whereby the slaves though reckoned as citizens in no other respect are counted to the extent of three fifths of their number in the estimate of the population for fixing the number of representatives of each state in the lower house of congress",

		"now when the mind of england and it may almost be said of the civilized part of mankind has been relieved from the incubus which had weighed on it ever since the trent outrage and when we are no longer feeling towards the northern americans as men feel towards those with whom they may be on the point of struggling for life or death now if ever is the time to review our position and consider whether we have been feeling what ought to have been felt and wishing what ought to have been wished regarding the contest in which the northern states are engaged with the south",
		"they know as all know who have attended to the subject that confinement within existing limits is its death warrant",
		"if however the purposes of the north may be doubted or misunderstood there is at least no question as to those of the south",
		"there is no denying that our attitude towards the contending parties i mean our moral attitude for politically there was no other course open to us than neutrality has not been that which becomes a people who are as sincere enemies of slavery as the english really are and have made as great sacrifices to put an end to it where they could",
		"could the union abandon them without even an effort to be dealt with at the pleasure of an exasperated slave owning oligarchy",
		"to allow the slave ships of a confederation formed for the extension of slavery to come and go free and unexamined between america and the african coast would be to renounce even the pretence of attempting to protect africa against the man stealer and abandon that continent to the horrors on a far larger scale which were practised before granville sharp and clarkson were in existence",

		"without insisting on these things i contend that all previous cause of offence should be considered as cancelled by the reparation which the american government has so amply made not so much the reparation itself which might have been so made as to leave still greater cause of permanent resentment behind it but the manner and spirit in which they have made it",
		"it is wonderful how easy and liberal and complying people can be in other people s concerns",
		"let us suppose the worst possible issue of this war the one apparently desired by those english writers whose moral feeling is so philosophically indifferent between the apostles of slavery and its enemies",
		"and no one can suppose that the south would have consented or in their present temper ever will consent to an accommodation on any other terms",
		"every reader of a newspaper to the farthest ends of the earth would have believed and remembered one thing only that at the critical juncture which was to decide whether slavery should blaze up afresh with increased vigor or be trodden out at the moment of conflict between the good and the evil spirit at the dawn of a hope that the demon might now at last be chained and flung into the pit england stepped in and for the sake of cotton made satan victorious",
		"that a sense of justice should be the motive which the rulers of a country rely on to reconcile the public to an unpopular and what might seem a humiliating act that the journalists the orators many lawyers the lower house of congress and mr lincoln s own naval secretary should be told in the face of the world by their own government that they have been giving public thanks presents of swords freedom of cities all manner of heroic honors to the author of an act which though not so intended was lawless and wrong and for which the proper remedy is confession and atonement that this should be the accepted policy supposing it to be nothing higher of a democratic republic shows even unlimited democracy to be a better thing than many englishmen have lately been in the habit of considering it and goes some way towards proving that the aberrations even of a ruling multitude are only fatal when the better instructed have not the virtue or the courage to front them boldly",
		"not by taking military possession of their country or marching an army through it but by wearing them out exhausting their resources depriving them of the comforts of life encouraging their slaves to desert and excluding them from communication with foreign countries",
		"but there was from the beginning and now is a large infusion of that element in it and this is increasing will increase and if the war lasts will in the end predominate",
		"the only real difference is that the present rebels are more powerful than cartouche or turpin and may possibly be able to effect their iniquitous purpose",
		"an article would have to be inserted prohibiting the extension of slavery to the territories or the admission into the union of any new slave state",

		"you will go to the circus",
		"then throwing back her head as if to call the heavens to witness she raised her great wide open eyes and gazed above",

		"now for the first time she was seized with a premonition of misfortune",
		"and this said the newly awakened meditative spirit within her need be no dream no it lay in her power to impart this happiness to herself and many others day by day until the end",
		"never had the red mosaic inscription seemed to shine so bright and friendly and she heard her name called in delighted tones from the kitchen",
		"philip s biting words had shown her what most of them must think of her and though the ship should bear her far away would it be right to bring diodoros away from his old father to follow her",
		"scarcely returned i had to receive the ambassadors from my mother and then came the troublesome affair with vindex",
		"caracalla being a man my calculations regarding him have generally proved right",
		"still it was absolutely necessary that she should restrain herself and endure his insufferable endearments and even force herself to speak",
		"to me life is the highest blessing and yours is dearer to me than my own",
		"may we meet again happily either here or else where",
		"thus far melissa had listened to the emperor s raging with panting bosom and quivering nostrils as at a performance which must sooner or later come to an end and now she broke in regardless of the consequences send for them she cried and order them to throw me to the wild beasts",
		"the ground seemed to heave beneath her feet sick and giddy she put out her hand to find some support that she might not sink on her knees in so doing she caught the tall tripod which held the dish of coals",
		"but we become accustomed even to the impossible",
		"reject not the splendid gift which the gods offer you that trouble may not come upon your city as it did on hapless troy all for a woman s sake",

		"the blessing of the thousands whom she could protect and save would make the hardest task sweet and endurable",
		"how sorrow and revenge have worked upon that strange woman",
		"but we are both like overfull vessels one drop will make them overflow",
		"they proceeded from the friends of caesar and the deep voices of the germanic bodyguard who joining in with the cries they had learned in the circus lent such impetuous force to the applause as even to satisfy this artist in the purple",
		"by all the gods",
		"here philostratus paused and gazed inquiringly at her but she only shook her head gently and answered my brain is so confused that i can scarcely hear even but i feel that your words are well meant and wise",
		"diodoros was up and had fully recovered",
		"then she drew herself up proudly and as she approached her friend felt with joy that she had chosen the better part yea that it would cost her but little to lay down her life for it",
		"with drooping head euryale re entered the room and gazed with kind anxious eyes into the girl s face as if asking her forgiveness",
		"but i must first have the certainty that it shall not be in vain",
		"at parting he kissed melissa and murmured would you really drive your old father out of our dear home away from his work and his birds from his garden and your mother s grave",
		"but the lady euryale of whom his late wife had always spoken with the highest respect and supported by her his son alexander had both represented to him so forcibly that a union with the emperor would render melissa most unhappy if it did not lead to death that he had been reduced to silence",
		"go you to him now and speak for me",
		"the moment melissa ceased he seized her hand and cried eagerly i will try it and if he grant your request you remain",
		"but that only turned my thoughts in the right direction",
		"yes answered the maiden firmly",
		"he only values in me the hand that eases his pain and want of sleep",
		"i will try answered the freedman gloomily",
		"when your hair lies smoothly round your sweet face as it did yesterday then lay it on my breast as often as you will",
		"if she listened to the wooing of her noble lover she would be able to tame this ungovernable being and soothe his fury and would gain in return for a sacrifice such as many had made before her the blissful consciousness of having rendered an inestimable service to the whole world",
		"you shall see",
		"you can not have asked yourself what would be the fate of a girl like melissa if she were caracalla s wife",
		"the attendant a slave who had grown gray in the service of timotheus now begged the young guest as though he represented his mistress to take a little food and not to sip so timidly from the winecup",
		"throughout this day you will doubtless need me and let me impress upon you once more to behave before caracalla in such a manner that even his suspicious mind may not guess what you intend to do",
		"and yet said philostratus you offered a sacrifice for the foreign tyrant",
		"now i understand your opposition and thank you for it",
		"and whither can she go",
		"you shall be mine",
		"asked the maiden gazing with anxious expectancy into the matron s face",
		"but i only transferred what i saw of good in caracalla to the figure of my hero",
		"the man s firm character had always gone against the gemcutter s surly capricious nature and it was no little satisfaction to him to let him feel his superiority and boast before him of the apparent good luck that had befallen the artist s family",
		"it is not a question now of a difference of opinion but of a serious danger which you with your easily moved heart will bring down upon yourself and me",
		"he repelled both greeting and presents but he longed to be revenged heavily and bloodily on zminis who denounced him and brought him to the galleys",
		"the litter stopped and argutis helped her to descend",
		"she hurried back into the sleeping room without regarding philostratus s answer",
		"on the way to the serapeum melissa s anxiety increased",
		"the lady begged that he as an artist would assist in choosing the robe and the less conspicuous and costly it was the better",
		"see philip our mother and andrew taught us often not to think only of ourselves but of others",
		"worthy of mesomedes",
		"he turned away from her and buried his face in the pillows",
		"here the tears which so easily rose to his eyes began to flow and seeing that melissa s tender heart was moved by his sorrow he gained confidence and reproached his daughter for having kindled caracalla s love by her radiant eyes so like her mother s",
		"he knows that without my telling him replied the freedman",
		"and then who can say for certain that i should succeed in persuading caesar to carry out my desires whatever they might be",
		"melissa nodded gratefully to her brother but heron remained firm in his assertion that to think of flight would be foolish or at least premature",
		"her hair had become disordered and as she smoothed it she looked in the mirror and could not but observe that in the simple but costly white robe of the dead korinna she looked like a maiden of noble birth rather than the lowly daughter of an artist",
		"if my flight is to bring danger if not death and ruin upon so many good people i had better stay",
		"you yourself were praising my boys just now",
		"but it soon vanished for scarcely had he finished when stormy shouts of applause rose from the antechamber",
		"a thousand voices shouted to her and beside her stood a horn of plenty running over with golden solidi and crimson roses and it never grew empty however much she took from it",
		"it did not escape me and i shall add it to the rest",
		"the weal or woe of her whole future depended on the answer she should give to philostratus",
		"we resolved yesterday to show one another what we could do as singers and lute players",
		"and this indelible mark of the crime which she had witnessed brought the image of the wounded aurelius before her just as he now lay shaken with fever so had she seen her lover a few days before",
		"but caracalla cried decisively no refusal i must beg",
		"then there was quiet for a time in the room only broken by diodoros s angry questions and the pacifying exclamations of the freedman",
		"the old man had some difficulty in following his young mistress and she soon stepped lightly over the welcome on the threshold of her father s house",
		"what is long enough for him will not be too short for me and now one of the emperor s chariots is waiting for me",
		"the rose too which the christian had given her for him and which lay in her lap she wished so much to carry to him herself",
		"first she prayed for strength to keep her vow come what might and then she prayed for diodoros that he might not be made wretched if she found herself compelled to break her troth with him",

		"mr fogg mrs aouda et passepartout s assirent sur un banc en face des sièges réservés au magistrat et au greffier",
		"et cependant dans le voisinage il y avait suivant l expression des astronomes un astre troublant qui aurait dû produire certaines perturbations sur le coeur de ce gentleman",
		"passepartout ne vit pas fix qui se tenait dans l ombre mais fix entendit le récit de ses aventures que passepartout narra en peu de mots à son maître",
		"monsieur monsieur fogg",
		"passepartout vers neuf heures du matin vint prendre l air sur les passerelles",
		"votre honneur cherche un bateau",
		"en admettant les chances les plus favorables notre collègue est à peine en amérique",
		"je n en sais rien monsieur le consul répondit le détective mais écoutez moi",
		"dans cette dernière traversée on ne s éloignerait pas de la côte chinoise ce qui serait un grand avantage d autant plus que les courants y portent au nord",
		"s écria t il maudissez moi",
		"quelques résines éclairaient la place",
		"pendant ces préliminaires passepartout bouillait d impatience car l aiguille lui paraissait marcher terriblement vite sur le cadran de la grosse horloge du prétoire",
		"où sommes nous",
		"phileas fogg avait donc gagné les vingt mille livres",
		"cette jeune dame peut nous accompagner",
		"comprenez vous",
		"la nuit vint",
		"mais je ne puis abuser vous n abusez pas et votre présence ne gêne en rien mon programme passepartout",
		"quelquefois mais en peu de mots brefs et clairs il redressait les mille propos qui circulaient dans le club au sujet des voyageurs perdus ou égarés il indiquait les vraies probabilités et ses paroles s étaient trouvées souvent comme inspirées par une seconde vue tant l événement finissait toujours par les justifier",
		"a huit heures moins cinq quelques minutes seulement avant le départ du train sans chapeau pieds nus ayant perdu dans la bagarre le paquet contenant ses emplettes passepartout arrivait à la gare du chemin de fer",
		"eh bien nous allons avoir un coup de vent",
		"xxxiii où phileas fogg se montre a la hauteur des circonstances une heure après le steamer henrietta dépassait le light boat qui marque l entrée de l hudson tournait la pointe de sandy hook et donnait en mer",
		"si phileas fogg manquait ne fût ce que de quelques heures le départ d un paquebot il serait forcé d attendre le paquebot suivant et par cela même son voyage était compromis irrévocablement",
		"on ne pouvait l estimer mathématiquement mais certainement la vitesse du traîneau ne devait pas être moindre de quarante milles à l heure",
		"d ailleurs fix il faut le dire n y comprenait plus rien",
		"il savait quelques refrains de france et d angleterre et il résolut de les essayer",
		"les passagers étaient assis sur le pont",
		"phileas fogg en personne",
		"passepartout sauta à terre",
		"et voilà ajouta william hitch voilà pourquoi la jalousie du congrès s est exercée contre nous",
		"il savait que dans la vie il faut faire la part des frottements et comme les frottements retardent il ne se frottait à personne",
		"convenait il de lui apprendre le rôle joué par fix dans cette affaire",
		"coûte que coûte il faut réussir",
		"enfin la chance se déclarait pour le représentant de la loi",
		"l équipage y mettait un zèle incroyable",
		"cinquante cinq mille",
		"un verre de gin monsieur passepartout",
		"aussi passepartout sans en avoir l air surveillait il son maître",
		"passepartout n osant aller prévenir son maître écoutait les dents serrées immobile comme une statue",
		"entre autres mets le maître d hôtel crut devoir lui recommander une certaine gibelotte de lapin du pays dont il lui dit merveille",
		"mais ainsi que vous à bombay",
		"quoi",
		"le soir seulement il demanderait à mrs aouda la permission de l entretenir pendant quelques instants",
		"oui sans doute",
		"ce soir là même mr fogg aussi impassible aussi flegmatique disait à mrs aouda ce mariage vous convient il toujours madame",
		"les faits sont avoués",
		"ah",
		"je n ai pas le temps aujourd hui",
		"ces innombrables armées de ruminants opposent souvent un insurmontable obstacle au passage des trains",
		"répondit non moins simplement mr fogg",
		"phileas fogg accepta la gibelotte et la goûta consciencieusement mais en dépit de sa sauce épicée il la trouva détestable",
		"vous êtes chargé pour",
		"les panneaux furent condamnés avec soin",
		"mr fogg n y était pas",
		"phileas fogg n avait plus que vingt quatre heures pour atteindre londres",
		"répondit passepartout cela arrangera mon maître",
		"passepartout ignorait ceci c est que si le cadran de sa montre eût été divisé en vingt quatre heures comme les horloges italiennes il n aurait eu aucun motif de triompher car les aiguilles de son instrument quand il était neuf heures du matin à bord auraient indiqué neuf heures du soir c est à dire la vingt et unième heure depuis minuit différence précisément égale à celle qui existe entre londres et le cent quatre vingtième méridien",
		"prolongés qui parcourent tous les intervalles de la gamme chromatique descendante",
		"en effet le steamer qui fait de yokohama à san francisco la traversée du pacifique était en correspondance directe avec le paquebot de hong kong et il ne pouvait partir avant que celui ci fût arrivé",
		"le policeman fit descendre ses prisonniers on pouvait vraiment leur donner ce nom et il les conduisit dans une chambre aux fenêtres grillées en leur disant c est à huit heures et demie que vous comparaîtrez devant le juge obadiah",
		"et maintenant y avait il un moyen quelconque de retenir mr fogg dans ce compartiment pour prévenir toute rencontre entre le colonel et lui",
		"passepartout consulta la liste",
		"il est à toi",
		"chère aouda répondit phileas fogg",
		"ce tour du monde à accomplir autrement qu en théorie et sur le papier dans ce minimum de temps avec les moyens de communication actuellement en usage ce n était pas seulement impossible c était insensé",
		"le train le train",
		"ces officiers dans leurs magnifiques costumes et au milieu de leur suite ressemblaient à des ambassadeurs et passepartout répétait plaisamment chaque fois qu il rencontrait quelque patrouille éblouissante allons bon",
		"dans la principale rue où se tient le marché s élevaient quelques hôtels ornés de pavillons et entre autres lake salt house",
		"certes l honnête garçon avait par prévision aussi copieusement déjeuné qu il avait pu avant de quitter le carnatic mais après une journée de promenade il se sentit l estomac très creux",
		"a l horizon un arrière plan de collines se profilait harmonieusement sur le fond du ciel",
		"les derniers indiens disparaissaient alors dans le sud du côté de republican river",
		"on s habille comme on peut",
		"un moment subjugué il redevenait lui même",
		"cependant le quai s animait peu à peu",
		"je pars à neuf heures dit simplement le capitaine speedy et si vous et les vôtres vous êtes là",
		"il ne faisait pas une enjambée de trop allant toujours par le plus court",
		"pendant ce temps mr fogg s était retourné vers mrs aouda",
		"une vingtaine de sioux frappés à mort étaient tombés sur la voie et les roues des wagons écrasaient comme des vers ceux d entre eux qui glissaient sur les rails du haut des passerelles",
		"mais voilà cinq ans que j ai quitté la france et que voulant goûter de la vie de famille je suis valet de chambre en angleterre",
		"passepartout pendant toute la durée de la bourrasque demeura sur le pont du rangoon",
		"bien",
		"avec notre train",
		"son maître lui ouvrait un crédit illimité",
		"passepartout mit le pied sans aucun enthousiasme sur cette terre si curieuse des fils du soleil",
		"mais certainement un gentleman aussi ménager de ses pas s arrêterait là oui sans doute mais il n en était pas moins vrai qu il partait qu il se déplaçait ce gentleman si casanier jusqu alors",
		"il ne put retenir un mouvement de son nez",
		"aucune station n était en vue",
		"sur cette réponse phileas fogg monta dans le wagon et le train partit à toute vapeur",
		"pas de mandat",
		"quand le vent soufflait soit de la côte d asie soit de la côte d afrique le mongolia long fuseau à hélice pris par le travers roulait épouvantablement",
		"les simples assistants au premier degré de la hiérarchie ont francs les juges f les présidents de cour f les gouverneurs f et le gouverneur général plus de f note de l auteur",
		"mon maître",
		"on rappela ce que l existence de phileas fogg avait de mystérieux son isolement son départ subit et il parut évident que ce personnage prétextant un voyage autour du monde et l appuyant sur un pari insensé n avait eu d autre but que de dépister les agents de la police anglaise",
		"fix dans son coin éprouvait une indicible satisfaction",
		"nul incident ne signala cette nuit",
		"ce personnage qui avait pris le train à la station d elko était un homme de haute taille très brun moustaches noires bas noirs chapeau de soie noir gilet noir pantalon noir cravate blanche gants de peau de chien",
		"ces gens là",
		"si les sculpteurs de l antiquité connaissaient dix huit façons d arranger la chevelure de minerve passepartout n en connaissait qu une pour disposer la sienne trois coups de démêloir et il était coiffé",
		"une seconde section d équilibristes vint se poser sur ces longs appendices une troisième s étagea au dessus puis une quatrième et sur ces nez qui ne se touchaient que par leur pointe un monument humain s éleva bientôt jusqu aux frises du théâtre",
		"au départ de calcutta après avoir laissé des instructions pour que le mandat s il arrivait enfin lui fût adressé à hong kong il avait pu s embarquer à bord du rangoon sans avoir été aperçu de passepartout et il espérait bien dissimuler sa présence jusqu à l arrivée du paquebot",
		"mais tout ce spectacle varié offert aux regards par le groupe des andaman passa vite et le rangoon s achemina rapidement vers le détroit de malacca qui devait lui donner accès dans les mers de la chine",
		"il n osait regarder l inspecteur de police",
		"et en même temps ce passager présentait un passeport sur lequel il désirait sans doute faire apposer le visa britannique",
		"toute la toile portait",
		"cela lui paraissait terrible d avoir à guider tant de dames à la fois au travers des vicissitudes de la vie à les conduire ainsi en troupe jusqu au paradis mormon avec cette perspective de les y retrouver pour l éternité en compagnie du glorieux smyth qui devait faire l ornement de ce lieu de délices",
		"l agent passa là quelques heures difficiles tantôt croyant tout perdu tantôt espérant que fogg ignorait la situation enfin ne sachant quel parti prendre",
		"le lendemain décembre à midi un homme monta sur la passerelle pour faire le point",
		"plusieurs fois répondit fix",
		"il avait reconnu l impossibilité de forcer l entrée du temple et il ramena ses compagnons en arrière",
		"certaines rues entre autres montgommery street le régent street de londres le boulevard des italiens de paris le broadway de new york étaient bordées de magasins splendides qui offraient à leur étalage les produits du monde entier",
		"a huit heures un steward entra dans le wagon et annonça aux voyageurs que l heure du coucher était sonnée",
		"soit dit froidement phileas fogg",
		"la nuit se passa",
		"toutefois le vent retomba dans le sud est",
		"il est évident se dit il que j ai été abominablement grisé",
		"comment la locomotive avait été détachée du train il ne put le deviner mais il n était pas douteux pour lui que le train resté en arrière se trouvât en détresse",
		"c est un parc coupé de belles routes",
		"enfin à sept heures du matin calcutta était atteint",
		"a bombay",
		"les gardes du rajah veillaient toujours à la lueur des torches et une vague lumière filtrait à travers les fenêtres de la pagode",
		"cris et coups de feu ne discontinuaient pas",
		"mais les voyageurs étaient trop heureux de pouvoir être agréables aux deux gentlemen et ils se retirèrent sur les passerelles",
		"fogg retenu huit jours à hong kong",
		"bien nourri bien logé il voyait du pays et d ailleurs il s affirmait à lui même que toute cette fantaisie finirait à bombay",
		"vous descendrez mon mackintosh et ma couverture de voyage",
		"passepartout fut dépêché à la recherche du steward et il revint bientôt avec deux jeux complets des fiches des jetons et une tablette recouverte de drap",
		"tenez",
		"et la détonation du petit canon de bronze éclata dans l air",
		"quant à passepartout il saisit la main du pilote et l étreignit vigoureusement en disant vous pilote vous êtes un brave homme",
		"s écria mrs aouda en portant la main à son coeur",
		"demanda mr fogg",
		"céderons nous à la force",
		"grave et importante affaire que cette alimentation du foyer des paquebots à de telles distances des centres de production",
		"entre huit et neuf milles au plus près",
		"le à sept heures du soir",
		"quant à passepartout la face rouge comme le disque solaire quand il se couche dans les brumes il humait cet air piquant",
		"son pari était irrévocablement perdu",
		"en allant à nagasaki l extrémité sud du japon onze cents milles ou seulement à shangaï à huit cents milles de hong kong",
		"mrs aouda savait très suffisamment le whist et elle reçut même quelques compliments du sévère phileas fogg",
		"videz les caisses à eau",
		"les deux amis n avaient pas encore osé parler de leur infortuné compagnon",
		"mais le docteur ne répondit pas",
		"l orateur se livra à une abondante harangue très fleurie très écoutée le docteur ne tarda pas à reconnaître que le victoria était tout bonnement pris pour la lune en personne et que cette aimable déesse avait daigné s approcher de la ville avec ses trois fils honneur qui ne serait jamais oublié dans cette terre aimée du soleil",
		"le vent a peur de souffler il dort",
		"c est là dit le docteur que burton et speke furent pris de fièvres violentes et crurent un instant leur expédition compromise et cependant ils étaient encore peu éloignés de la côte mais déjà la fatigue et les priva tions se faisaient rudement sentir",
		"voilà donc ce qu il méditait depuis deux ans",
		"joe avec la hache qu il avait heureusement retrouvée brisa les défenses de l éléphant",
		"trois heures plus tard la prédiction du docteur se réalisait",
		"il procéda aussitôt à la construction de son foyer qui flambait quelques instants plus tard",
		"pas un obstacle en vue",
		"je demande à ne pas en essayer répliqua simplement joe",
		"maudite chaleur",
		"fit joe vous pensez mon maître que l équateur passe par ici",
		"on peut le rassurer dit le docteur fergusson",
		"et voici comment j obtiens ce résultat",
		"une objection",
		"un immense cri des arabes s éleva dans l air mais tout entiers à leur poursuite ils n avaient pas vu le victoria à cinq cents pas derrière eux et à trente pieds du sol à peine eux mêmes ils n étaient pas à vingt longueurs de cheval du fugitif",
		"pouah",
		"tu veux que le docteur nous abandonne",
		"se dit il et quelle mort",
		"et la raison s il vous plaît",
		"et tout cela sans parler des bêtes et des peuplades féroces",
		"c est kabra s écria joyeusement le docteur c est le port de tembouctou la ville n est pas à cinq milles d ici",
		"le malheureux s écria le chasseur",
		"si cela m est possible répondit fergusson je me porterai plus directement au nord pendant sept à huit degrés j essayerai de remonter vers des latitudes présumées des sources du nil peut être apercevrons nous quelques traces de l expédition du capitaine speke ou même la caravane de m de heuglin",
		"étrange revirement",
		"l insensé traverser l afrique en ballon",
		"a l apparition de l aérostat il y eut un temps d arrêt les hurlements redoublèrent quelques flèches furent lancées vers la nacelle et l une d elles assez près pour que joe l arrêtât de la main",
		"cependant dit le commandant cela peut être dangereux",
		"de la prudence monsieur dick de la prudence",
		"ces divers préparatifs se terminèrent le février au soir",
		"effrayés de la détonation les gypaètes s écartèrent un instant mais ils revinrent presque aussitôt à la charge avec une rage extrême",
		"l air de l appartement est forcé de passer par les tuyaux et il est restitué avec une température plus élevée",
		"dans la nacelle le docteur accablé les bras croisés sur la poitrine regardait dans l espace un point imaginaire avec une fixité idiote",
		"ils descendaient près des longues pirogues qui sillonnaient le lac",
		"fi donc",
		"mais la nacelle se trouvait encore un peu au dessous des quartiers de rocs contre lesquels elle allait inévitablement se briser",
		"vers quatre heures joe signala un objet en relief sur l immense plateau de sable et il put affirmer bientôt que deux palmiers s élevaient à une distance peu éloignée",
		"encore une victime",
		"montons avant que ces nuages se résolvent en eau et que le vent ne se déchaîne",
		"kennedy lui indiquait les obstacles à surmonter et le victoria volait par les airs en rasant la montagne",
		"mais il est bien important de ne pas nous séparer",
		"voici le résumé de ses différents calculs fergusson",
		"à terre",
		"des voyageurs se font traîner en ballon par des chameaux arrive un lion qui dévore les chameaux avale la remorque et traîne à leur place ainsi de suite",
		"patience dick",
		"reprit joe avec un gros soupir je regretterai plus d une fois mes cailloux en or massif",
		"oh",
		"c est notre avis samuel et nous sommes prêts à t obéir",
		"dit le docteur avec désespoir",
		"le vent portait au sud mais le docteur ne s inquiéta pas de cette direction elle lui permettait au contraire de suivre la route tracée par les capitaines burton et speke",
		"il ne peut nous voir dans sa fuite",
		"fergusson ne tarda pas à avoir l explication de ce phénomène",
		"il se frotta les yeux il se leva",
		"kennedy apercevait des lièvres et des cailles qui ne demandaient pas mieux que de recevoir un coup de fusil mais c eût été de la poudre perdue attendu l impossibilité de ramasser le gibier",
		"dit il une inondation",
		"le docteur n hésita pas et précipitant un fragment de quartz il se tint hors des atteintes de ces oiseaux dangereux",
		"dick se précipita sur sa carabine et joe s empara de l un des fusils",
		"le désert se faisait peu à peu",
		"bientôt les crêtes d une montagne prirent une taille plus arrêtée",
		"c est un peu lourd pour notre nacelle",
		"le victoria courait de véritables bordées dans les airs",
		"c est lui à cheval",
		"kennedy prit son fusil mais le docteur lui ordonna de ne point tirer",
		"demanda le docteur",
		"répondit le chasseur nous les écarterions à coups de fusil",
		"le victoria disparaissait entièrement dans l ombre",
		"s écria le lieutenant",
		"espérez encore lui répondit kennedy",
		"répondit celui ci",
		"voilà",
		"un jour on s entretenait de la direction des ballons et fergusson fut sollicité de donner son avis à cet égard",
		"voilà qui est bien ordonné répondit le docteur",
		"alors joe retira le dîner de la fournaise il déposa cette viande appétissante sur des feuilles vertes et disposa son repas au milieu d une magnifique pelouse il apporta des biscuits de l eau de vie du café et puisa une eau fraîche et limpide à un ruisseau voisin",
		"le victoria rendu à la liberté entraîna les voyageurs vers le nord est avec une vitesse de dix huit milles",
		"sans doute m samuel aura procédé à une nouvelle installation pour rétablir l équilibre mais la journée d hier a dû suffire à ces travaux il ne serait donc pas impossible qu aujourd hui mais agissons comme si je ne devais jamais le revoir",
		"ah",
		"joe prit les couvertures et les précipita au dehors",
		"ne cherche pas à décrocher l ancre",
		"demanda kennedy",
		"fit joe",
		"c est ainsi monsieur dick",
		"c est évidemment reprit kennedy une manœuvre ou une chasse",
		"parfaitement mes préparatifs vont bon train et je où sont ils que je les mette en pièces tes préparatifs",
		"wig a more",
		"s écria joe palpitant",
		"rarement l altitude des montagnes de l afrique parait être médiocre relativement aux sommets de l europe et de l asie",
		"les dangers sont en bas et non en haut",
		"comme il avait des vivres en suffisante quantité le docteur résolut d attendre en cet endroit un vent favorable",
		"hôpital de fous à londres",
		"au soir le victoria s était avancé de quatre vingt dix milles dans l ouest il se trouvait alors en droite ligne à quatorze cents milles de zanzibar",
		"les bords hérissés de boissons épineux et de broussailles enchevêtrées disparaissaient littéralement sous des myriades de moustiques d un brun clair ce pays devait être inhabitable et inhabité on voyait des troupes d hippopotames se vautrer dans des forêts de roseaux ou s enfuir sous les eaux blanchâtres du lac",
		"cela ferait bien sur les bords du lac lomond et les touristes y courraient en foule",
		"lui",
		"que veux tu que devienne notre infortuné compagnon",
		"a onze heures le victoria s était avancé de quatre vingt dix milles il rencontra alors un nouveau courant qui sous un angle presque droit le poussa vers l est pendant une soixantaine de milles",
		"il faut absolument nous relever",
		"ils abandonnent alors la ligne perpendiculaire et font un crochet dans l ouest vers ghât guidés non sans difficultés par les touaregs",
		"impossible répondit kennedy je ne pourrais faire un pas",
		"son examen terminé le docteur s occupa de mettre ses notes en ordre",
		"il se faisait de grandes cavités dans l enveloppe de l aérostat le vent s y engouffrait avec violence et le taffetas détonait sous sa pression",
		"sur l une d entre elles s élevaient quelques cases de bergers mais il fut impossible d en faire un relèvement exact car la vitesse du victoria s accroissait toujours",
		"de plus dans le cas d un accident d une déchirure arrivée au ballon extérieur l autre avait l avantage d être préservé",
		"le docteur fergusson et son fidèle joe demeurèrent les mêmes hommes que nous avons connus",
		"nous nous arrêtons dit l écossais",
		"la soirée fut charmante et se passa sous de frais ombrages de mimosas après un repas réconfortant le thé et le grog n y furent pas ménagés",
		"les deux dormeurs réveillés à ce bruit épouvantable se tenaient à ses ordres",
		"comment",
		"ainsi nous pouvons tenter l aventure",
		"en au mois d août le jeune voyageur roscher de hambourg parti avec une caravane de marchands arabes atteignait le lac nyassa où il fut assassiné pendant son sommeil",
		"mon pauvre joe cette idée un autre l a eue avant toi elle a été exploitée par un très spirituel auteur français m méry dans un roman il est vrai",
		"mais que faire",
		"pendant le reste de la nuit le corps fut veillé tour à tour par le docteur kennedy joe et pas une parole ne troubla ce religieux silence chacun pleurait",
		"c est vraiment une contrée magnifique et l on rencontrerait difficilement une végétation plus belle",
		"mais ce que précisément il ne faut pas faire c est d essayer",
		"mais alors le victoria se perdait au loin dans le ciel",
		"le ciel t entende",
		"mais kennedy le surveillait et d une balle de sa carabine il brisa l arme dans la main du cheik",
		"et le chasseur essuya rapidement les verres de la lunette et se prit à regarder",
		"dit joe après cela s ils avaient un uniforme ils seraient comme tous les guerriers du monde",
		"est ce qu il y a quelque chose de nouveau non",
		"des arabes monsieur de vrais arabes avec leurs chameaux",
		"rugissements de la tribu à laquelle le prisonnier échappait dans un rayon d une éblouissante lumière",
		"les anglais furent conduits à un poste provisoire établi sur le bord du fleuve ils y trouvèrent les soins les plus attentifs et des provisions en abondance",
		"il y a des intrigants",
		"descendons nous",
		"nous n irons pas si loin mon ami du moins je l espère",
		"le vent un beau jour y a jeté une graine de palmier et le palmier a poussé comme en plein champ",
		"répliqua le docteur nous allons vivre au contraire",
		"fit le docteur qui avait repris sa tranquille impassibilité",
		"samuel et dick sautèrent sur le sol tandis que l aérostat à demi dégonflé se balançait au dessus du corps de l animal",
		"nous tenons la vie de quatre de ces moricauds dans nos mains",
		"oui répondit fergusson",
		"le lundi le temps changea complètement la pluie se mit à tomber avec une grande violence il fallut résister à ce déluge et à l accroissement de poids dont il chargeait le ballon et la nacelle cette perpétuelle averse expliquait les marais et les marécages qui composaient uniquement la surface du pays la végétation y reparaissait avec les mimosas les baobabs et les tamarins",
		"mon cher dick je ne te dirai qu une seule chose je ne perdrai pas un atome de gaz pas une molécule",
		"le docteur chercha vainement un courant à différentes hauteurs en voyant ce calme de la nature il résolut de passer la nuit dans les airs et pour plus de sûreté il s éleva de pieds environ",
		"comme cet homme a souffert",
		"qu est ce donc",
		"c est tout de même une fameuse idée que vous avez eue là monsieur dit joe la manœuvre n est difficile ni fatigante on tourne un robinet et tout est dit",
		"sa résignation et sa patience eurent de la peine à tenir contre une pareille situation",
		"ce fut une déroute générale",
		"dix coups retentirent encore",
		"l hydrogène se rendait dans une vaste tonne centrale après avoir été lavé à son passage et de là il passait dans chaque aérostat par les tuyaux d introduction",
		"quelques cheveux plus ras sur le sommet du crâne indiquaient encore la place d une tonsure à demi effacée",
		"non",
		"et que nous manque t il pour cela",
		"ils se sentirent forts de la même idée",
		"au bout de ses deux heures kennedy revint avec un chapelet de perdrix grasses et un cuissot d oryx sorte de gemsbok appartenant à l espèce la plus agile des antilopes",
		"chapitre xxiii colère de joe la mort d un juste la veillée du corps aridité",
		"fergusson ne pouvait qu obéir à cette tourmente il se croisa les bras et s absorba dans ses tristes réflexions",
		"nous ne voyagerons pas la nuit",
		"mes amis",
		"il reconnut avec satisfaction que le courant le portait vers la rive septentrionale du tchad et il le laissa faire",
		"la mousson souffla avec une violence extrême pendant la matinée du lendemain le vent s engouffrait dans les cavités inférieures du ballon s agitait violemment l appendice par lequel pénétraient les tuyaux de dilatation on dut les assujettir par des cordes manœuvre dont joe s acquitta fort adroitement",
		"jusqu au sénégal cette partie de l afrique est signalée comme dangereuse",
		"dix minutes après le victoria s enlevait majestueusement pendant que le docteur fergusson en signe de succès déployait le pavillon aux armes d angleterre",
		"le victoria retenu sur une seule ancre n éprouvait aucune oscillation",
		"oui",
		"si cela se peut pourquoi pas",
		"deux heures après avoir quitté le nautilus nous avions franchi la ligne des arbres et à cent pieds au dessus de nos têtes se dressait le pic de la montagne dont la projection faisait ombre sur l éclatante irradiation du versant opposé",
		"et quelle mort",
		"il est certain que la monotonie du bord devait paraître insupportable au canadien habitué à une vie libre et active",
		"ils y étaient mais ils n y sont plus",
		"il coupait la masse des eaux avec un frémissement sonore",
		"je regardai après avoir un instant fermé mes yeux éblouis par le jet électrique",
		"c étaient des pingouins aussi agiles et souples dans l eau où on les a confondus parfois avec de rapides bonites qu ils sont gauches et lourds sur terre",
		"le fanal éclairait en entier sa surface paisible qui ne connaissait ni les rides ni les ondulations",
		"je n ai point rêvé",
		"ordinairement qui ne peut aller plus loin en est quitte pour revenir sur ses pas",
		"mais bientôt le baril revint à la surface et peu d instants après apparut le corps de l animal retourné sur le dos",
		"sans doute il se redresserait lorsque le bloc s arrêterait lui même",
		"je passai les trois quarts de cette journée sur la plate forme",
		"avec toute la force électrique fut mise sur les pompes qui aussitôt commencèrent à chasser l eau des réservoirs",
		"mes deux compagnons s enivraient près de moi de ces fraîches molécules",
		"mais elle a toujours pour noyau un petit corps dur soit un ovule stérile soit un grain de sable autour duquel la matière nacrée se dépose en plusieurs années successivement et par couches minces et concentriques",
		"c était à la hauteur de saint jean de terre neuve et de heart s content où aboutit l extrémité du câble transatlantique",
		"eh bien monsieur",
		"la saison d ailleurs était déjà fort avancée puisque le mars des terres antarctiques correspond au septembre des régions boréales qui commence la période équinoxiale",
		"le vaisseau nous restait à un mille et demi et avec les première lueurs du jour sa canonnade recommença",
		"lui demandai je",
		"une vague réverbération éclairait son gréement et indiquait que les feux étaient poussés à outrance",
		"je l ai lu à conseil et au canadien",
		"ses compagnons et lui furent remplacés par de nouveaux travailleurs auxquels nous nous joignîmes conseil et moi",
		"a l instant",
		"c est ce qui a fait dire à buffon que ces cétacés pouvaient et devaient même vivre mille ans",
		"en effet là sous mes yeux ruinée abîmée jetée bas apparaissait une ville détruite ses toits effondrés ses temples abattus ses arcs disloqués ses colonnes gisant à terre où l on sentait encore les solides proportions d une sorte d architecture toscane plus loin quelques restes d un gigantesque aqueduc ici l exhaussement empâté d une acropole avec les formes flottantes d un parthénon là des vestiges de quai comme si quelque antique port eût abrité jadis sur les bords d un océan disparu les vaisseaux marchands et les trirèmes de guerre plus loin encore de longues lignes de murailles écroulées de larges rues désertes toute une pompéi enfouie sous les eaux que le capitaine nemo ressuscitait à mes regards",
		"et cependant ce ne sera pas sans une sorte de regret que j emporterai ce que la générosité du capitaine nous aura laissé pénétrer des mystères du nautilus",
		"le point n ayant pas été fait à dessein peut être j ignorais notre position",
		"ils se battent",
		"le capitaine anderson ses officiers ses ingénieurs se réunirent délibérèrent et firent afficher que si le coupable était surpris à bord il serait jeté à la mer sans autre jugement",
		"beaucoup de gens ami ned",
		"et ce disant le capitaine nemo déploya un pavillon noir portant un n d or écartelé sur son étamine",
		"eh",
		"descendez",
		"c étaient des balistes américains pour lesquels la nature n a broyé que du blanc et du noir des bobies plumiers allongés et charnus aux nageoires jaunes à la mâchoire proéminente des scombres de seize décimètres à dents courtes et aiguës couverts de petites écailles appartenant à l espèce des albicores",
		"a peu près monsieur le professeur",
		"après un demi mille le sol se montra tout criblé de nids de manchots sortes de terriers disposés pour la ponte et dont s échappaient de nombreux oiseaux",
		"après deux heures d un travail énergique ned land rentra épuisé",
		"ce qui eût désobligé le capitaine nemo car il ne verse pas inutilement le sang des bêtes inoffensives",
		"ne l ai je pas compris par moi même",
		"ce fut là une des raisons qui amenèrent colomb à supposer l existence d un nouveau monde",
		"les parois latérales et la surface inférieure de la banquise s épaississaient visiblement",
		"bien imaginé monsieur aronnax répondit en souriant le capitaine",
		"mais si nous retournions au pacifique loin de toute terre habitée que devenaient les projets de ned land",
		"oui",
		"le fond océanique formait alors une vallée large de cent vingt kilomètres sur laquelle on eût pu poser le mont blanc sans que son sommet émergeât de la surface des flots",
		"d ailleurs nous eûmes à peine le temps de réfléchir",
		"bon",
		"bientôt nous fûmes emprisonnés jusqu au cou dans le vêtement de caoutchouc et des bretelles fixèrent sur notre dos les appareils à air",
		"c étaient ou des pirapèdes ou des trigles milans à bouche lumineuse qui pendant la nuit après avoir tracé des raies de feu dans l atmosphère plongeaient dans les eaux sombres comme autant d étoiles filantes",
		"oui cette nuit même en quelques minutes nous avons franchi cet isthme infranchissable",
		"on le dépeça sous les yeux du canadien qui tenait à suivre tous les détails de l opération",
		"le rémora que j avais observé dans la méditerranée appartient à cette espèce",
		"mais le fait le plus étonnant et qui ne permet plus de nier l existence de ces animaux gigantesques s est passé il y a quelques années en",
		"ainsi en angleterre et en amérique seulement cinq mille navires montés par soixante quinze mille marins sont employés à la pêche de la morue",
		"conseil le regardait avec un intérêt tout scientifique et je suis sûr qu il le rangeait non sans raison dans la classe des cartilagineux",
		"s écria le canadien",
		"voyez monsieur voyez le travail qui s accomplit sous ces flots",
		"ce ne sont pas des animaux dangereux",
		"enfin les perles pour lesquelles l on emploie les tamis percés de neuf cents à mille trous forment la semence",
		"la situation paraissait terrible",
		"le lendemain janvier nous coupions l équateur sur le quatre vingt deuxième méridien et nous rentrions dans l hémisphère boréal",
		"le capitaine nemo vint prendre la hauteur du soleil ainsi qu il avait fait la veille",
		"le temps était couvert",
		"ses compagnons étaient ils morts avec lui",
		"j étais je l avoue peu préparé à cette communication",
		"je suis de l avis de monsieur dit conseil",
		"ce n est pas moi qui l ai été chercher",
		"pendant la nuit du au février nous étions entrés dans ce second bassin méditerranéen dont les plus grandes profondeurs se trouvent par trois mille mètres",
		"puis je revins à ma chambre",
		"xxi une hécatombe cette façon de dire l imprévu de cette scène cet historique du navire patriote froidement raconté d abord puis l émotion avec laquelle l étrange personnage avait prononcé ses dernières paroles ce nom de vengeur dont la signification ne pouvait m échapper tout se réunissait pour frapper profondément mon esprit",
		"elle sait que je ne peux rien contre elle",
		"les panneaux se refermèrent et la route fut donnée directement à l ouest",
		"rien ou presque rien puisque nous n avons encore parcouru que six mille lieues à travers le pacifique",
		"preuve certaine que ces nuages se tenaient à une hauteur médiocre car le volcan ne s élevait pas à plus de huit cents pieds au dessus du niveau de l océan",
		"je vous ferai seulement observer qu après avoir émis tant d objections contre mon projet maintenant vous m écrasez d arguments en sa faveur",
		"peut être hésitait il encore",
		"faisons la sauter et si elle résiste donnons des ailes au nautilus afin qu il puisse passer par dessus",
		"nous sillonnions alors les flots de l océan indien vaste plaine liquide d une contenance de cinq cent cinquante millions d hectares et dont les eaux sont si transparentes qu elles donnent le vertige à qui se penche à leur surface",
		"a sa sortie du canal de bahama sur quatorze lieues de large et sur trois cent cinquante mètres de profondeur le gulf stream marche à raison de huit kilomètres à l heure",
		"on eût dit que le capitaine nemo voulant une mort digne de lui cherchait à se faire foudroyer",
		"cependant le capitaine nemo après avoir terminé son opération m avait dit remontons monsieur le professeur",
		"mon brave ned répondis je en riant c étaient des perles artificielles de simples globules de verre enduits à l intérieur d essence d orient",
		"c est un animal de grande taille",
		"de rapides courants entraînaient tous ces gaz en diffusion et les torrents laviques glissaient jusqu au bas de la montagne comme les déjections du vésuve sur un autre torre del greco",
		"les premières paroles que je prononçai furent des paroles de remerciements et de gratitude pour mes deux compagnons",
		"mes regards se reportèrent sur le manomètre",
		"les matelots se remirent à nager et le patron dirigea l embarcation vers le baril flottant",
		"l instrument fut braqué sur ces sites du fond océanique et en quelques secondes nous avions obtenu un négatif d une extrême pureté",
		"étant donné la capacité du navire que monsieur connaît et par conséquent la quantité d air qu il renferme sachant d autre part ce que chaque homme dépense dans l acte de la respiration et comparant ces résultats avec la nécessité où le nautilus est de remonter toutes les vingt quatre heures la phrase de conseil n en finissait pas mais je vis bien où il voulait en venir",
		"pendant cette journée le nautilus recommença plusieurs fois cette même expérience et toujours il vint se heurter contre la muraille qui plafonnait au dessus de lui",
		"ned land et conseil évitaient de me parler par crainte de se trahir",
		"cependant le nautilus remontait lentement vers la surface de la mer et je vis disparaître peu à peu les formes confuses du vengeur",
		"les accords de l orgue raisonnaient faiblement",
		"accepterez vous",
		"qu éprouvait il alors",
		"tout homme par cela seul qu il est homme vaut qu on songe à lui",
		"la nuit est sombre",
		"l ombre du rocher nous dérobait a ses regards",
		"dix ou douze poulpes avaient envahi la plate forme et les flancs du nautilus",
		"une nuit et un jour suffirent à l anéantissement de cette atlantide dont les plus hauts sommets madère les açores les canaries les îles du cap vert émergent encore",
		"pendant toute la journée du mai le nautilus décrivit sur la mer une série de cercles qui m intriguèrent vivement",
		"les heures qui s écoulèrent ainsi je ne saurais les évaluer",
		"il était debout à l avant près de son pavillon qu une légère brise déployait au dessus de sa tête",
		"le lendemain l océan avait repris son aspect accoutume",
		"mais là quelle tranquillité quel silence quel milieu paisible",
		"cependant par quatorze mille mètres j aperçus des pics noirâtres qui surgissaient au milieu des eaux",
		"il ne le fit pas",
		"qu y a t il",
		"affronter une mer souvent démontée sur un frêle canot c était courir à une perte certaine",
		"les filets ramassèrent aussi un poisson hardi audacieux vigoureux bien musclé armé de piquants à la tête et d aiguillons aux nageoires véritable scorpion de deux à trois mètres ennemi acharné des blennies des gades et des saumons c était le cotte des mers septentrionales au corps tuberculeux brun de couleur rouge aux nageoires",
		"quel malheur qu un secret pareil doive mourir avec son inventeur",
		"chasser des loutres dans les forêts sous marines comme nous l avons fait dans les forêts de l île crespo passe encore",
		"mais ce que vous ne savez sans doute pas monsieur aronnax c est que au commencement du monde les baleines filaient plus rapidement encore",
		"c était donc une occasion favorable malgré les trente milles qui séparaient le nautilus des côtes de l union",
		"et pourquoi cela",
		"malheureusement reprit il je ne puis vous conduire à travers ce canal de suez mais vous pourrez apercevoir les longues jetées de port saïd après demain quand nous serons dans la méditerranée",
		"dans ces conditions le baromètre se tint généralement très bas",
		"il était formé par une ligne allongée de la petite île manaar",
		"je crus avoir mal entendu mais je ne pus réitérer mon observation car la tête du capitaine avait déjà disparu dans son enveloppe métallique",
		"ils n avaient pas même d instruments pour relever leur direction et ils marchaient à l estime au milieu de courants qu ils connaissaient à peine",
		"sans doute mais en avançant vers le fond du golfe vous remarquerez cette singulière apparence",
		"pour terminer enfin conseil classa une grande quantité de poissons volants",
		"la banquise",
		"mille ans répondit le canadien sans hésiter",
		"ned land le comprit sans doute car il ne me parla de rien",
		"dans cet espace resserré entre le cap bon et le détroit de messine le fond de la mer remonte presque subitement",
		"j aurais voulu plonger mes regards par la vitre du salon à travers les eaux de l atlantique mais les panneaux étaient hermétiquement fermés et un manteau de tôle me séparait de cet océan que je ne connaissais pas encore",
		"cinq milles la séparaient encore et son rivage se confondait avec les eaux brumeuses",
		"je ne remarquai pour mon compte que quelques cacouannes a carapace allongée",
		"nous restâmes à cette place pendant une heure entière contemplant la vaste plaine sous l éclat des laves qui prenaient parfois une intensité surprenante",
		"alors monsieur aronnax je vous proposerai une curieuse excursion",
		"c étaient ces mêmes parages où le capitaine denham de l hérald fila quatorze mille mètres de sonde sans trouver de fond",
		"on y voit ces roches primordiales qui n ont jamais connu la lumière des cieux ces granits inférieurs qui forment la puissante assise du globe ces grottes profondes évidées dans la masse pierreuse ces profils d une incomparable netteté et dont le trait terminal se détache en noir comme s il était dû au pinceau de certains artistes flamands",
		"celui ci relevé sans blessures alla droit à l indien coupa vivement la corde qui le liait à sa pierre le prit dans ses bras et d un vigoureux coup de talon il remonta à la surface de la mer",
		"le capitaine nemo n ayant pas encore paru le canot nous prit conseil et moi et nous mit à terre",
		"en effet dis je",
		"personne n est supérieur à un homme généreux et bon et vous l êtes",
		"le nautilus dut donc s arrêter dans son aventureuse course au milieu des champs de glace",
		"que lui aurais je dit après tout",
		"un torrent nous avait portés d une mer à l autre",
		"je discutais la question de l atlantide en homme qui ne peut plus douter",
		"vers le soir il flottait déjà sous l immense carapace glacée de la banquise",
		"il faut le voir conseil",
		"les étranges marins du nautilus se contentaient de l air qui circulait à l intérieur",
		"je fis quelques pas à l intérieur",
		"non",
		"c était horrible",
		"je sentis que ned land me glissait un poignard dans la main",
		"j étais prêt",
		"je soupai avec appétit d un excellent morceau de foie de phoque dont le goût rappelait celui de la viande de porc",
		"volontiers monsieur aronnax",
		"je ne pus y tenir",
		"c est convenu capitaine",
		"en somme on peut évaluer à neuf millions de francs le rendement général de l exploitation des perles",
		"pour mon compte je n avais plus aucun souci des dangers que mon imagination avait exagérés si ridiculement",
		"d ailleurs nous serons armés et chemin faisant nous pourrons peut être chasser quelque squale",
		"vous avez vu cela",
		"l arabe edrisi qui la dépeint sous le nom de golfe de colzoum raconte que les navires périssaient en grand nombre sur ses bancs de sable et que personne ne se hasardait à y naviguer la nuit",
		"est ce un archipel",
		"pas d oiseaux si ce n est quelques couples de ces corneilles qui s élèvent jusqu aux dernières couches de l air respirable",
		"et d abord pourquoi ces gens d origines diverses s étaient ils attachés à sa fortune",
		"fit observer phil evans montrant frycollin qui soufflait comme un phoque il faut le déficeler",
		"de visu parce que leur regard put se porter sur tous les points de ce triangle de cinq à six kilomètres que forme la ville de auditu parce que ce jour était un jour de grand marché et qu il s y faisait un bruit effroyable de olfactu parce que le nerf olfactif ne pouvait être que très désagréablement affecté par les odeurs de la place de youbou kamo où s élève la halle aux viandes près du palais des anciens rois so maïs",
		"on nous surveille même quand nous ne croyons pas être surveillés répondit uncle prudent",
		"alors ce doit être un navire ou tout au moins une embarcation",
		"ce fut le juillet que la terre réapparut dans le sud ouest à peu près vers le cap des vierges à l entrée du détroit de magellan",
		"et à quoi tenait que phil evans n eût été nommé président du club",
		"mais laquelle de ces milliers dont est semé le pacifique",
		"uncle prudent et phil evans si mal disposés qu ils fussent se sentaient intéressés par ce spectacle",
		"master tapage",
		"et n était ce pas sombrer dans cette mer aérienne au milieu d une nuit dont les fanaux de l aéronef ne rompaient la profondeur que sur un rayon restreint",
		"la tempête s était donc un instant apaisée en apparence du moins",
		"comme vous le dites",
		"quelque curieux que ce soit répliqua phil evans",
		"un signal sans doute et dans ce cas c est que le moment était venu d exécuter quelque œuvre de violence",
		"le au matin l albatros atteignit le détroit de la pérouse resserré entre la pointe septentrionale du japon et l île saghalien dans cette petite manche où se déverse ce grand fleuve sibérien l amour",
		"aujourd hui verrons nous l ingénieur robur",
		"heureusement frycollin ne soupçonnait rien de ces projets",
		"mais en italie aux stations météorologiques du vésuve au poste de l etna installé dans l ancienne casa inglese au monte cavo les observateurs n hésitèrent pas à admettre la matérialité du phénomène attendu qu ils l avaient pu voir un jour sous l aspect d une petite volute de vapeur une nuit sous l apparence d une étoile filante",
		"qu il eût rompu toute relation avec les habitants de la terre soit",
		"si j avais eu l honneur de présider le weldon institute jamais non jamais il ne se serait produit un tel scandale",
		"apparemment quand il aura fini ses courses",
		"demanda le contremaître turner",
		"un peu avant minuit une aurore australe illumina ces ténèbres",
		"dès lors on est arrivé à imaginer ou construire plus de soixante appareils qui n ont jamais pu voler",
		"aussi avait il la pupille de ses yeux si largement dilatée qu elle s agrandissait jusqu à la circonférence de l iris",
		"en le marquis de bacqueville fabrique un système d ailes l essaie au dessus de la seine et se casse le bras en tombant",
		"mais probablement le rendement des machines du go a head devait être très inférieur au rendement des appareils de l albatros le go a head avait été transporté après son gonflement dans la clairière de fairmont park à la place même où s était reposé l aéronef pendant quelques heures",
		"mais ici la maison c était le globe terrestre",
		"soudain le baromètre après s être tenu assez haut pendant les premières heures de la journée tomba brusquement",
		"quels cris il poussa lorsque le contremaître et un de ses camarades le saisirent et l attachèrent dans une sorte de baille à laquelle ils fixèrent solidement l extrémité d un câble",
		"il fallut se résigner momentanément ce qui n est guère dans le tempérament yankee et tout attendre du hasard ce qui doit répugner à des esprits éminemment pratiques",
		"que ce robur y prenne garde",
		"question d amour propre",
		"deux revolvers suffiraient si j en tenais un monsieur et si vous teniez l autre",
		"la cité c était tombouctou",
		"le nègre se redressa",
		"aucune terre en vue ni du côté de l asie ni du côté de l europe",
		"là prise tout d abord pour un engin explosif elle fut déficelée développée ouverte avec une extrême prudence",
		"plus d herbe rien que de rares phanérogames sur la limite de la vie végétale",
		"l albatros va descendre et s arrêter pendant la pèche est ce que nous ne pourrions pas profiter",
		"robur posté à l avant sa mâle figure sous son capuchon commandait les manœuvres",
		"mais cette fois il faut le dire à son honneur le public terrestre se retint sur cette pente",
		"restait la question de savoir si les bowie knifes pourraient entamer les parois si leurs lames ne s émousseraient pas ou ne se briseraient pas dans ce travail",
		"répondit uncle prudent",
		"faisait le nègre en recommençant ses lamentations",
		"or il se trouvait que dans cette lutte des inventeurs à la recherche d un moteur puissant et léger les américains s étaient le plus rapprochés du fameux desideratum",
		"cet état de choses ne pouvait qu inquiéter beaucoup robur relativement à ses projets ultérieurs",
		"en un mot il faut n arriver qu à son heure",
		"nul doute que la lueur eût été observée en divers postes successivement dans le laps de quelques heures",
		"le plus intrépide de vos aéronautes john wise bien qu il ait déjà fait une traversée aérienne de douze cents milles au dessus du continent américain a dû renoncer à son projet de traverser l atlantique",
		"commencement d agitation",
		"uncle prudent commença par écraser une petite quantité de poudre de manière à la réduire à l état de pulvérin",
		"a tout citoyen qui rien n y fit",
		"mer mauvaise toujours",
		"autour du bâti quelques légers montants reliés par un treillis de fil de fer supportent une rambarde qui sert de main courante",
		"ainsi disparut la frontière de la perse et ses longues plaines qui restèrent invisibles",
		"jamais",
		"bref une minute après cette agression sans qu aucun mot eût été échangé entre les agresseurs uncle prudent phil evans et frycollin sentaient qu on les déposait doucement non sur l herbe de la clairière mais sur une sorte de plancher que leur poids fit gémir",
		"il était plus mort que vif",
		"vers onze heures du matin la capitale apparut dans sa ceinture de murailles défendue par un fossé mesurant douze milles de tour rues larges et régulièrement tracées sur un sol plat grande place dont le côté nord est occupé par le palais du roi",
		"le lendemain juillet vers sept heures du matin une terre fut signalée dans le nord",
		"l évasion d uncle prudent et de phil evans c était son secret c était sa personnalité révélés à tous",
		"la chauve souris qui vole si je ne me trompe",
		"ils les obligèrent à laisser fouiller leurs maisons quitte à les indemniser plus tard du tort fait à la vie privée de chacun laquelle est particulièrement respectée chez les peuples d origine anglo saxonne",
		"tom dit l ingénieur pousse les fanaux à pleine lumière",
		"demanda uncle prudent",
		"au pied du tertre une cinquantaine de musiciens jouaient de leurs instruments barbares défenses d éléphants qui rendent un son rauque tambours tendus d une peau de biche calebasses guitares clochettes frappées d une languette de fer flûtes de bambou dont l aigre sifflet dominait tout l ensemble",
		"poussés à travers leurs bâillons à des soubresauts de carpes qui se pâment hors de leur bassin natal",
		"une autre ville",
		"cinq mille dollars",
		"je le ferai",
		"les voilà",
		"robur très contrarié de cet accident ne put marcher pendant toute cette journée qu à une vitesse relativement modérée",
		"de vous et des vôtres reprit uncle prudent que son collègue essayait en vain de calmer",
		"il ne serait pas digne de conquérir l espace s il était incapable de le dévorer",
		"ce fut jem cip le trésorier du weldon institute",
		"de retour",
		"tandis que l on travaillait à l avant de l aéronef uncle prudent et phil evans avaient entre eux une conversation dont les conséquences allaient être d une gravité exceptionnelle",
		"mon maître",
		"avant peu il serait plongé dans cette nuit permanente qui ne s illumine qu à la clarté de la lune ou aux pâles lueurs des aurores australes",
		"a la pointe du sud est émergeait un îlot précédé d un semis de roches",
		"au dessus de la plate forme trente sept axes se dressent verticalement dont quinze en abord de chaque côté et sept plus élevés au milieu",
		"en tout cas il est doué d une vitesse excessive et il ne peut tarder à passer au dessus de la foule",
		"rien",
		"là il s était emparé d une certaine quantité de poudre et d une cartouche semblable à celles dont l ingénieur avait fait usage au dahomey",
		"cela pouvait durer longtemps à moins que le gouvernement n intervînt",
		"evidemment sous le crâne de ces deux têtes anglo saxonnes s incrustait un entêtement qui serait dur à déraciner",
		"les malheureux se jetèrent dessus et burent à même avec une avidité qui faisait mal à voir",
		"uncle prudent et phil evans étaient donc redevenus les prisonniers de l ingénieur robur",
		"l albatros fut il vu des arabes des mozabites et des nègres qui se partagent l oasis de ouargla",
		"et pendant combien de temps citoyen ingénieur demanda uncle prudent qui éclata à la fin pendant combien de temps avez vous la prétention d exercer ce droit",
		"telle fut alors la rapidité imprimée à l albatros que avant huit heures le dôme du capitole pointait à l horizon de l ouest pour disparaître bientôt à l horizon opposé",
		"là les inventeurs font expérimenter des machines dont quelques unes sont déjà brevetées de ponton d amécourt et son hélicoptère à vapeur de la landelle et son système à combinaisons d hélices avec plans inclinés et parachutes de louvrié et son aéroscaphe d esterno et son oiseau mécanique de groof et son appareil à ailes mues par des leviers",
		"c était lui qui montait l aéronef albatros c était lui qui par représailles avait enlevé uncle prudent phil evans et frycollin par dessus le marché",
		"mais maintenant",
		"prétend il les garder en son pouvoir les condamner à l aviation à perpétuité",
		"mais s ils avaient pu échapper à l asphyxie comment lui et les siens ne s étaient ils pas noyés dans les eaux du pacifique",
		"il ne faut pas s en étonner étant donné la vitesse avec laquelle l aéronef avait traversé l europe du nord au sud et la méditerranée de l ouest à l est",
		"peut être trouverez vous que je parle trop de moi",
		"mais les deux propulseurs avaient souffert et plus encore que ne le croyait robur",
		"on l a vu cependant toutes les difficultés de mécanique n étaient pas encore tranchées",
		"dit il",
		"par un léger vent de cinq à six mètres à la seconde passe encore",
		"une même pensée avait traversé leur cerveau",
		"tous étaient venus affirmer par leur présence que rien ne pourrait jamais séparer les partisans du plus léger que l air",
		"on les adora ou peu s en faut",
		"mais ce qui est connu c est que ce pôle austral est plus froid que le pôle boréal phénomène dû à la position de la terre sur son orbite durant l hiver des régions antarctiques",
		"cela fait les deux tableaux étant exposés dans le même jour au milieu de la salle des séances les deux concurrents s armèrent chacun d une fine aiguille et marchèrent simultanément vers le tableau qui lui était dévolu",
		"qui êtes vous",
		"nous venons vous secourir",
		"cela se passait dans une ville des etats unis dont le développement rapide fut supérieur même à celui de new york de chicago de cincinnati de san francisco une ville qui n est pourtant ni un port ni un centre minier de houille ou de pétrole ni une agglomération manufacturière ni le terminus d un rayonnement de voies ferrées une ville plus grande que berlin manchester edimbourg liverpool vienne pétersbourg dublin une ville qui possède un parc dans lequel tiendraient ensemble les sept parcs de la capitale de l angleterre une ville enfin qui compte actuellement près de douze cent mille âmes et se dit la quatrième ville du monde après londres paris et new york",
		"voici les cathédrales an glaise et française",
		"cependant à bord on ne souffrait pas trop de la température beaucoup moins basse alors qu on ne devait le craindre",
		"cette catastrophe fut d autant plus à craindre que le vent inclina vers l est en dépassant le méridien zéro",
		"l ingénieur il est vrai avait donné la direction ainsi que fait un capitaine en tenant compte de l altitude nécessaire pour dominer les hauts sommets du territoire",
		"dès onze heures l énorme aérostat se balançait à quelques pieds du sol prêt à s élever au milieu des airs",
		"il avait fallu s élever pour éviter les montagnes japonaises de fousi zama",
		"la bombe remplie d une matière fulminante fit alors explosion et en éclatant lança une sorte de petit harpon à deux branches qui s incrusta dans les chairs de l animal",
		"il n est pas permis d en douter",
		"ce fut un deuil général et le mot deuil n est pas exagéré car à part quelques cerveaux brûlés comme il s en rencontre même aux etats unis on n espérait plus jamais revoir ces deux honorables citoyens",
		"répliqua robur",
		"disait il",
		"vous êtes ici une centaine qui croyez à la réalisation de vos rêves qui jetez non dans l eau mais dans l espace des milliers de dollars",
		"cette circonstance allait faire tourner les choses tout autrement qu ils l imaginaient",
		"ce lac était alors entièrement glacé et quelques indigènes leurs longues raquettes aux pieds glissaient rapidement à la surface",
		"montagnes abruptes pics éternellement neigeux avec d épaisses forêts étagées sur leurs flancs mers intérieures baies formées entre les presqu îles et les îles de cet archipel ensemble des terres de clarence dawson désolation canaux et passes innombrables caps et promontoires tout ce fouillis inextricable dont la glace faisait déjà une masse solide depuis le cap forward qui termine le continent américain jusqu au cap horn où finit le nouveau monde",
		"puis lorsque les dernières notes se furent noyées dans un épouvantable charivari uncle prudent profitant d une accalmie momentanée crut devoir dire citoyen étranger jusqu ici on vous a laissé parler sans vous interrompre il paraît que pour le président du weldon institute ces reparties ces cris ces coq à l âne n étaient même pas des interruptions mais un simple échange d arguments",
		"il viendra livrer le secret d une invention qui peut modifier les conditions sociales et politiques du monde",
		"vengez vous président du weldon institute",
		"il n eut donc point sa part des acclamations frénétiques qui accueillirent le président et le secrétaire du weldon institute",
		"c était une attaque directe aux projets du weldon institute qui avait décrété soutenu subventionné la confection d un aérostat monstre",
		"correspondre",
		"de ces légers appareils les uns revinrent rapidement à terre en accentuant leurs accords les autres tombèrent comme des oiseaux qu un plomb a frappés aux ailes et dont le chant finit avec le dernier souffle",
		"il ne sera pas dit que l albatros n aura pas essayé de venir à leur secours",
		"cet axe est il vertical",
		"n était ce pas répondre à une véritable déclaration de guerre jetée au camp des ballonistes",
		"frycollin n était pas moins pris par le cerveau que par l estomac",
		"il faudra tenter de fuir",
		"l albatros redevenu maître de sa direction ne tarderait pas à regagner l île chatam dont les fugitifs ne pourraient s enfuir de sitôt",
		"répondit uncle prudent",
		"faire part aux amis et connaissances",
		"en somme les appareils qui peuvent résoudre ce problème se résument en trois sortes les hélicoptères ou spiralifères qui ne sont que des hélices à axes verticaux les orthoptères engins qui tendent à reproduire le vol naturel des oiseaux les aéroplanes qui ne sont à vrai dire que des plans inclinés comme le cerf volant mais remorqués ou poussés par des hélices horizontales",
		"c était une chute de trois mille mètres pour les huit hommes accrochés comme des naufragés à cette épave",
		"le go a head avait une forme allongée qui faciliterait son déplacement suivant l horizontale",
		"c est déjà beaucoup et ne m obligez pas à vous les allonger encore en commençant par vos oreilles a la porte",
		"au loin apparaissaient des oueds aux eaux torrentueuses des forêts de palmiers des pâtés de petites huttes groupées sur un mamelon autour d une mosquée entre autres metliti où végète un chef religieux le grand marabout sidi chick",
		"expliquons le de n importe quelle façon phil evans excepté par l hypothèse que notre prison ait changé de place",
		"on allait donc enfin procéder à cette grande expérience que le weldon institute préparait de si longue date et avec tant de soins",
		"et alors puisque le sens de la vue leur manquait ils s essayèrent à tirer par le sens de l ouïe quelque indice de ce qu était cet inquiétant état de choses",
		"mais pendant le jour avait on jamais vu quelque chose d anormal dans l air",
		"l acte de vengeance aurait été accompli dans toute son horreur",
		"s écria philevans",
		"xi dans lequel la colère de uncle prudent croît comme le carré de la vitesse",
		"soit",
		"peut être eût il perçu une odeur de poudre brûlée",
		"oui dans les limites de l albatros",
		"les gens de l albatros s étaient rapprochés dans des dispositions peu bienveillantes",
		"ah",
		"vous ne vous êtes pas dit une seule fois qu il pouvait y avoir de ma faute",
		"depuis quelque temps j entendais une rumeur grossissante derrière moi",
		"lui aussi avec sa robe rouge s est penché sur le cadavre de la féodalité qu il avait égorgée et comme jean de bourgogne il a dit éteignez tout et allez vous en elle est morte",
		"le rhône monte toujours et atteint une hauteur de vingt trois pieds au dessus de son cours ordinaire",
		"ce que vous faites est bien fait",
		"c est remarquable comme il fait froid en afrique",
		"imaginez vous la plus délicieuse retraite qu il y ait au monde avec des forêts de pins qui au mois d août ne laissent point passer un rayon de soleil avec des vergers d amandiers qui au mois de mars quand à paris tombe la véritable neige froide et glacée secouent eux leur neige parfumée et rose sur des gazons qui n ont pas cessé d être verts",
		"et vous avez voté pour la prison",
		"le poète a écrit l or est une chimère sachons nous en servir",
		"c était à qui remercierait le grand artiste auquel on devait cette magnifique soirée",
		"à peine fut elle arrivée à paris au bout de dix sept jours ayant encore par conséquent pour treize jours d eau du nil que quoiqu elle n eût que sept mois l hippopotame mâle qui en avait dix sept se rua sur elle avec une brutalité qui faisait plus d honneur à sa passion qu à sa courtoisie",
		"chaque étranger qui est venu visiter le tombeau et tout le monde y est venu le chemin d ornolac est constamment encombré chaque personne dis je a voulu avoir son morceau du malheureux saule et l on a fini par le faire sécher",

		"elle adressa à notre saint père le pape une supplique fort détaillée mais il est à croire que françois cenci avait pris ses précautions car il ne paraît pas que cette supplique soit jamais parvenue aux mains de sa sainteté du moins fut il impossible de la retrouver à la secrétairerie des memoriali lorsque béatrix étant en prison son défenseur eut le plus grand besoin de cette pièce elle aurait pu prouver en quelque sorte les excès inouïs qui furent commis dans le château de petrella",
		"la seule action vertueuse qu il ait faite pendant toute sa longue vie a été de bâtir dans la cour de son vaste palais près du tibre une église dédiée à saint thomas et encore il fut poussé à cette belle action par le désir singulier d avoir sous ses yeux les tombeaux de tous ses enfants pour lesquels il eut une haine excessive et contre nature même dès leur plus tendre jeunesse quand ils ne pouvaient encore l avoir offensé en rien",

		"on donna une sépulture honorable à françois cenci et les femmes revinrent à rome jouir de cette tranquillité qu elles avaient désirée en vain depuis si longtemps",
		"mais avant d aller à la messe la signora béatrix considéra qu il n était pas convenable de paraître sur l échafaud aux yeux de tout le peuple avec les riches habillements qu elles portaient",

		"en apprenant le sort de son fils christophe il s écria qu il ne pourrait goûter quelque joie que lorsque tous ses enfants seraient enterrés et que lorsque le dernier viendrait à mourir il voulait en signe de bonheur mettre le feu à son palais",
		"de là l extrême volupté dit on d avoir une maîtresse religieuse remplie de piété sachant fort bien qu elle fait le mal et demandant pardon à dieu avec passion comme elle pêche avec passion supposons un chrétien extrêmement pervers né à rome au moment où le sévère pie v venait de remettre en honneur ou d inventer une foule de pratiques minutieuses absolument étrangères à cette morale simple qui n appelle vertu que ce qui est utile aux hommes",
		"tout semblait terminé et personne ne doutait plus dans rome que cette jeune fille si belle si courageuse et qui avait inspiré un si vif intérêt ne fût bientôt mise en liberté lorsque par malheur la justice vint à arrêter le brigand qui à terni avait tué olimpio conduit à rome cet homme avoua tout",
		"la vie leur devint absolument insupportable et ce fut alors que voyant bien qu elles n avaient rien à espérer de la justice du souverain dont les courtisans étaient gagnés par les riches cadeaux de françois elles eurent l idée d en venir au parti extrême qui les a perdues mais qui pourtant a eu cet avantage de terminer leurs souffrances en ce monde",

		"les bonnes paroles ni les menaces du juge moscati n y firent rien",
		"il était frère du signor renzi si connu dans rome",
		"je suis convaincu que la tragédie de galeoto manfredi qui fut tué par sa femme sujet traité par le grand poète monti et tant d autres tragédies domestiques du quinzième siècle qui sont moins connues et à peine indiquées dans les histoires particulières des villes d italie finirent par une scène semblable à celle du château de petrella",
		"ce n est que plus tard et lorsqu il commence à se pervertir que le don juan trouve une volupté exquise à braver les opinions qui lui semblent à lui même justes et raisonnables",
		"vers minuit béatrix introduisit elle même dans la forteresse marzio et olimpio ensuite lucrèce et béatrix les conduisirent dans la chambre du vieillard qui dormait profondément",
		"celui ci pénétré d enthousiasme pour l admirable beauté et l éloquence étonnante de la jeune fille répondant au juge nia tout ce qu il avait avoué à naples",
		"ce mémorial parlait aussi au nom de lucrèce belle mère de béatrix",
		"il lui dit de se placer à cheval sur la planche du cep",
		"tout ce monde fut conduit à naples enchaîné et rien ne parut suspect dans les dépositions si ce n est que la blanchisseuse dit avoir reçu de béatrix un drap ou des draps ensanglantés",
		"rien d aimable ne nous reste de ce don juan son caractère ne fut point adouci et amoindri par l idée d être avant tout homme de bonne compagnie comme le don juan de molière",
		"le pauvre bernard cenci qui était toujours resté assis sur l échafaud tomba de nouveau évanoui et il fallut plus d une grosse demi heure à ses confortatori pour le ranimer",
		"mais ce mouvement lui parut offensant pour la pudeur et elle mit beaucoup de temps à le faire",
		"cette hypocrisie si ennuyeuse et qui ne trompe personne a l immense avantage de donner quelque chose à dire aux sots ils se scandalisent de ce qu on a osé dire telle chose de ce qu on a osé rire de telle autre etc",
		"elles se croyaient heureuses à jamais parce qu elles ne savaient pas ce qui se passait à naples",
		"de là elles jetèrent le corps sur un grand sureau qui croissait en ce lieu solitaire",
		"en effet ce barbare eut le courage de tourmenter sans pitié un si beau corps ad toturam capillorum c est à dire qu on donna la question à béatrix cenci en la suspendant par les cheveux",
		"il voyageait toujours seul et sans prévenir personne quand son premier cheval était fatigué il en achetait ou en volait un autre",
		"il envoya les trois aînés jacques christophe et roch étudier à l université de salamanque en espagne",
		"le père comme nous l avons dit plus haut sortit de prison en donnant une grosse somme d argent à qui le pouvait protéger",
		"j ai partagé la curiosité commune ensuite comme tout le monde j ai cherché à obtenir communication des pièces de ce procès célèbre",
		"mais le jour suivant ils furent séparés de nouveau les deux frères furent conduits à la prison de tordinona et les femmes restèrent à la prison savella",
		"samedi matin septembre les premiers seigneurs de rome membres de la confrérie des confortatori se rendirent aux deux prisons à corte savella où étaient béatrix et sa belle mère et à tordinona où se trouvaient jacques et bernard cenci",
		"il fut convenu de plus que la chose aurait lieu le jour de la nativité de la vierge et à cet effet ces deux hommes furent introduits avec adresse dans la forteresse",
		"animés par ce peu de paroles fulminantes et craignant quelque diminution dans le prix convenu les assassins rentrèrent résolument dans la chambre et furent suivis par les femmes",
		"bien moins encore oseriez vous le regarder en face s il était éveillé",
		"deux cent mille piastres font à peu près cinq millions de",
		"les femmes avaient toutes les deux les mains libres mais les bras liés au corps de façon que chacune d elles pouvait porter un crucifix elles le tenaient fort près des yeux",
		"jacques cenci fut assommé mazzolato",
		"la signora lucrèce qui avait le coeur moins ferme pleurait presque continuellement la jeune béatrix au contraire montrait un grand courage et tournant les yeux vers chacune des églises devant lesquelles la procession passait se mettait à genoux pour un instant et disait d une voix ferme adoramus te christe",
		"on décida qu on les ferait cacher dans les forêts voisines de la petrella qu on les avertirait du moment où françois cenci se mettrait en chemin qu ils l enlèveraient sur la route et feraient annoncer à sa famille qu ils le délivreraient moyennant une forte rançon",
		"c est le type de la matrone romaine dans sa beauté et sa fierté naturelles",
		"les femmes restées seules commencèrent par retirer ce grand clou enfoncé dans la tête du cadavre et celui qui était dans le cou ensuite ayant enveloppé le corps dans un drap de lit elles le traînèrent à travers une longue suite de chambres jusqu à une galerie qui donnait sur un petit jardin abandonné",
		"l affaire se traita avec toutes les formes convenables et l on prit sur toutes choses le vote de la belle mère et de la jeune fille",
		"il suivit de là que sa sainteté lui ôta la direction de ce procès et la donna à un autre juge plus sévère",
		"dieu",
		"j ai acheté la permission de copier un récit contemporain j ai cru pouvoir en donner la traduction sans blesser aucune convenance du moins cette traduction put elle être lue tout haut devant des dames en",
		"le pape se rappela le fratricide des massini commis peu de temps auparavant",
		"de cette façon personne ne devait être amené à soupçonner les véritables auteurs de cette mort",
		"au moyen de ces lettres il fut convenu que monsignor guerra promettrait à marzio et olimpio mille piastres s ils voulaient se charger eux mêmes de mettre à mort françois cenci",
		"mis trois fois en prison pour ses amours infâmes il s en tira en donnant deux cent mille piastres aux personnes en faveur auprès des douze papes sous lesquels il a successivement vécu",
		"une inquisition inexorable et tellement inexorable qu elle dura peu en italie et dut se réfugier en espagne venait d être renforcée et faisait peur à tous",
		"mais la jeune béatrix avait le courage de la pudeur offensée et non la prudence nécessaire dans la vie dès le grand matin elle avait donné à une femme qui blanchissait le linge dans la forteresse un drap taché de sang parce que toute la nuit elle avait souffert d un grande perte de façon que pour le moment tout se passa bien",
		"c est qu il y a le diable et l amour la peur de l enfer et une passion exaltée pour une femme c est à dire ce qu il y a de plus terrible et de plus doux aux yeux de tous les hommes pour peu qu ils soient au dessus de l état sauvage",
		"le gouverneur revint à son palais fort touché de l ordre qu il venait de recevoir il expédia aussitôt la sentence de mort et rassembla une congrégation pour délibérer sur le mode d exécution",
		"elle fut enterrée devant le grand autel et la transfiguration de raphaël d urbin",
		"ce corps fit son unique affaire de cultiver et de fortifier le sentiment religieux il inventa des prestiges et des habitudes pour émouvoir les esprits de toutes les classes depuis le pâtre inculte jusqu au vieux courtisan blasé il su lier son souvenir aux impressions charmantes de la première enfance il ne laissa point passer la moindre peste ou le moindre grand malheur sans en profiter pour redoubler la peur et le sentiment religieux ou tout au moins pour bâtir une belle église comme la salute à venise",
		"violer les lois dans la monarchie à la louis xv tirer un coup de fusil à un couvreur et le faire dégringoler du haut de son toit n est ce pas une preuve que l on vit dans la société du prince que l on est du meilleur ton et que l on se moque fort du juge",
		"c est un beau contraste avec la figure si douce si simple presque allemande de sa belle fille",
		"qu y a t il de nouveau",
		"aussitôt que giacomo et la signora lucrèce la virent le péché est commis lui crièrent ils il faut faire aussi la pénitence et ne pas se laisser déchirer le corps par une vaine obstination",
		"qu eût on fait si elle eût consenti",
		"le jeune bernard recouvert de son manteau galonné fut conduit directement sur l échafaud alors tous crurent qu on allait le faire mourir et qu il n avait pas sa grâce",
		"une fois qu ils furent dans ce pays lointain il prit un malin plaisir à ne leur faire passer aucune remise d argent de façon que ces malheureux jeunes gens après avoir adressé à leur père nombre de lettres qui toutes restèrent sans réponse furent réduits à la misérable nécessité de revenir dans leur patrie en empruntant de petites sommes d argent ou en mendiant le long de la route",
		"la signora lucrèce petroni était tellement accoutumée à la mollesse et aux aisances du plus grand luxe et d ailleurs elle était d une taille tellement forte qu elle ne put supporter la question de la corde elle dit tout ce qu elle savait",
		"le troisième portrait de la galerie barberini est celui de lucrèce petroni belle mère de béatrix qui fut exécutée avec elle",
		"la fin de cette note latine est touchante mais je suppose que le lecteur est las d une si longue histoire",
		"mais il vrai de dire que du temps de ma jeunesse c est à dire quand il avait quarante huit ou cinquante ans personne n était assez hardi pour lui résister",
		"si ce grand peintre s est acquitté de cette tâche comme il a fait pour les autres peintures qu il a exécutées dans cette capitale la postérité pourra se faire quelque idée de ce que fut la beauté de cette fille admirable",
		"le crime de santa croce était un crime vil commis pour l avoir de l argent et le crime de béatrix fut commis pour sauver l honneur",
		"a cette occasion il montra sa noire impiété car aux funérailles de ses deux fils il ne voulut pas dépenser même un baïoque pour des cierges",
		"son désavantage est de raccourcir infiniment le domaine de l histoire",
		"avec ce secours fort médiocre ils se séparèrent de lui",
		"afin qu elle puisse aussi conserver quelque souvenir de ses malheurs sans pareils et de la force étonnante avec laquelle cette âme vraiment romaine sut les combattre j ai résolu d écrire ce que j ai appris sur l action qui l a conduite à la mort et ce que j ai vu le jour de sa glorieuse tragédie",
		"nous n avons que deux portraits du don juan d italie tel qu il dut se montrer en ce beau pays au seizième siècle au début de la civilisation renaissante",
		"pour que le don juan soit possible il faut qu il y ait de l hypocrisie dans le monde",
		"ce grand peintre a placé sur le cou de béatrix un bout de draperie insignifiant il l a coiffée d un turban il eût craint de pousser la vérité jusqu à l horrible s il eût reproduit exactement l habit qu elle s était fait faire pour paraître à l exécution et les cheveux en désordre d une pauvre fille de seize ans qui vient de s abandonner au désespoir",
		"le gouvernement seul parlait de s abstenir il défendait les choses qui pouvaient nuire à la patrie c est à dire à l intérêt bien entendu de tous et non ce qui peut nuire à l individu qui agit",
		"bientôt après à l occasion de ses amours infâmes françois fut mis en prison pour la troisième et dernière fois sur quoi les trois frères sollicitèrent une audience de notre saint père actuellement régnant et le prièrent en commun de faire mourir françois cenci leur père qui dirent ils déshonorait leur maison",
		"le voile de la jeune fille était de taffetas bleu comme sa robe elle avait de plus un grand voile de drap d argent sur les épaules une jupe de drap violet et des mules de velours blanc lacées avec élégance et retenues par des cordons cramoisis",
		"ainsi fut fait elle avoua tout ce qui était vrai",
		"la procession put à peine traverser le bas de la place du pont saint ange tant était grand le nombre des carrosses et la foule du peuple",
		"le nombre de morts fut très considérable",
		"on conçoit que l étrange démarche de ses trois fils aînés dut augmenter encore la haine qu il portait à ses enfants",
		"j écrirai avec une certaine liberté assuré que je suis de pouvoir déposer mon commentaire dans des archives respectables et d où certainement il ne sera tiré qu après moi",
		"comment étonnerais je mes sots contemporains",
		"rome tout entière était dans l anxiété lorsque le pape reçut la nouvelle de la mort violente de la marquise constance santa croce",
		"ce pauvre enfant eut une telle peur qu il tomba évanoui au second pas qu il fit sur l échafaud",
		"elle craignit que le juge ulysse moscati si célèbre pour sa profonde science et la sagacité si supérieure de son esprit n eût été vaincu par la beauté de béatrix et ne la ménageât dans les interrogatoires",
		"cet exemple a ému la signora lucrèce qui elle aussi a fait son testament et ordonné que son corps fût porté à saint georges elle a laissé cinq cent mille francs d aumônes à cette église et fait d autres legs pieux",
		"c étaient bien des sangliers",
		"le lendemain tous arrivaient sans encombre à travers une sorte de plaine déserte à babadagh mais tellement tard qu il parut plus convenable de continuer le voyage pendant la nuit",
		"non certes",
		"ils étaient donc dans une bonne moyenne et s ils s y maintenaient pendant vingt six jours encore jusqu au septembre courant ils devaient avoir achevé le tour de la mer noire dans les délais voulus",
		"répondit le hollandais",
		"vous êtes prêt van mitten",
		"et pourquoi voulez vous que je ressente de l émotion",
		"ces cônes de déjections s ouvrent en grand nombre à la surface de la presqu île de taman",
		"van mitten et lui remirent à bruno et à nizib les deux narghilés qui avaient failli se transformer en engins de guerre et tous eurent bientôt repris place dans leur voiture de voyage",
		"puis le bac fut démarré il déborda et le courant le porta vers la côte opposée",
		"il y a si peu d eau",
		"en cela comme en tout",
		"dit le hollandais",
		"eh bien vous passerez le second",
		"fit van mitten comme si on lui eût appris une chose toute nouvelle pour lui",
		"pendant ce temps le seigneur kéraban continuait de causer avec van mitten et disait mon ami sélim toujours pressé et mon neveu ahmet plus impatient encore voulaient conclure le mariage immédiatement",
		"c est donc l abkasie qui de tous les districts caucasiens sera le plus tard entré en jouissance des bienfaits de la liberté individuelle la première halte que firent les voyageurs après avoir franchi la frontière fut à la bourgade de gagri joli village avec une charmante église de sainte hypata dont la sacristie sert maintenant de cellier un fort qui est en même temps un hôpital militaire un torrent sec alors le gagrinska la mer d un côté de l autre toute une campagne fruitière plantée de grands accacias semée de bosquets de roses odorantes",
		"vous lui aviez écrit pourtant cher ahmet",
		"en effet en ramassant leurs bouquins les deux disputeurs s étaient trompés et avaient pris le tuyau l un de l autre ce qui faisait que sans s en apercevoir et tout en continuant à proclamer les qualités supérieures de leurs tabacs de prédilection kéraban fumait du latakié pendant que van mitten fumait du tombéki",
		"s ils eussent été libres ils se seraient jetés à travers la campagne et ce n aurait plus été qu une question de vitesse entre eux et la bande sauvage",
		"le pilaw fut remplacé sur leur table par une sorte de substance noirâtre fumée comme une plaque de cheminée après un long séjour au fond de l âtre",
		"pas un aperçu nouveau pas une impression digne de fixer le souvenir",
		"mais ahmet avait énergiquement pris son parti",
		"sont ils heureux ces étrangers",
		"s écria kéraban",
		"ne pleurez pas chère amasia",
		"a huit heures du soir la frontière de l abkasie était atteinte et les voyageurs y faisaient halte au relais de poste où ils dormirent jusqu au lendemain matin",
		"eh bien marchands de vin ou marchands de tabac c est exactement la même chose",
		"il a fait le vrai commerce qui convienne à ce pays",
		"comment de l eau de cerise au coup de canon",
		"la caisse aux provisions remplie plus rien à craindre sous ce rapport pendant un nombre considérable de verstes ou plutôt d agatchs puisque les provinces de la turquie asiatique allaient être traversées pendant cette seconde partie de l itinéraire mais ahmet en homme avisé ne pouvait que s applaudir d avoir pourvu à toutes les éventualités de l alimentation et de la locomotion",
		"s écria bruno",
		"le seigneur kéraban hors de lui voulut se jeter sur son adversaire mais celui ci poussant son cheval traversa la voie dédaigneusement sans même l honorer d un regard et suivi de ses quatre cavaliers il disparut au galop sur cette autre route qui suit la rive droite du fleuve",
		"si",
		"fit ahmet il ne faudrait pas risquer de faire attendre l oncle kéraban",
		"là s ouvrait un passage à niveau qu il fallait nécessairement franchir si l on voulait en abrégeant la route rejoindre poti par la rive gauche du fleuve",
		"franchement on ne pouvait exiger mieux dans l auberge d une petite bourgade perdue sur les extrêmes confins de la mer noire et l appétit aidant les convives firent honneur à ce repas qui variait l ordinaire de leurs provisions de voyage",
		"en partant il m a donné une nouvelle preuve de son amour",
		"que venez vous faire ici",
		"et vous allez bien seigneur kéraban",
		"je vous trouve froid pour votre femme",
		"que vous ayez des chevaux ou non il faut que nous partions à l instant",
		"oui",
		"il venait de s embarquer sur le steamer qui fait escale aux diverses échelles de l asie mineure",
		"nous le verrons bien répondit le hollandais mais va toujours chercher mes bagages pendant que j achèterai un guide pour étudier ces divers pays et un carnet pour noter mes impressions puis tu reviendras ici bruno et tu te reposeras",
		"il s agit bien de mariage scarpante prenant alors yarhud à part il n y a pas une heure à perdre",
		"la nuit s acheva sans incidents grâce à un long et sinueux lacet que faisait la route aux approches de viza pour éviter les rudes pentes et les terrains marécageux de la vallée",
		"ah",
		"la route qui la suit en partie est assez bonne depuis la ville jusqu au lazaret puis elle devient difficile et glissante en descendant les pentes vers le littoral",
		"le seigneur ahmet",
		"oui",
		"que j irais sur le ventre",
		"pendant quelques instants le seigneur kéraban et van mitten tout à cette infinie jouissance que procure le narghilé bien préférable au chibouk au cigare ou à la cigarette demeurèrent silencieux les yeux à demi fermés et comme appuyés sur les volutes de vapeurs qui leur faisaient un édredon aérien",
		"puis la vieille ville et ses quartiers neufs s illuminèrent comme par magie",
		"son nom est guïdare la guïdare en effet capitaine yarhud venait de mouiller en cette partie de la baie",
		"je m en moque de votre bosphore vous dites van mitten",
		"voyez",
		"cependant s il n y en a pas",
		"répondit nizib",
		"tenez cette mosquée là bas ce n est pas sainte sophie c est saint paul",
		"en ce moment un des serviteurs de l habitation celui qui d après les usages ottomans était uniquement destiné à annoncer les visiteurs parut à l une des portes latérales de la galerie",
		"et nous trouverons bien ajouta ahmet quelque soierie qui plaise à cette folle de nedjeb",
		"au delà de cette branche du danube qui va se jeter dans la mer noire à sulina ce n était plus qu un vaste marécage au travers duquel se dessinait une route à peu près impraticable",
		"en ma qualité de turc j aime les histoires et en ma qualité de célibataire j adore surtout les histoires de ménage",
		"il importait de traverser au plus vite cette zone dangereuse",
		"au point de vue administratif la turquie d europe est divisée en vilayets gouvernements ou départements administrés par un vali gouverneur général sorte de préfet nommé par le sultan",
		"la crimée",
		"mais puisqu on ne peut se rafraîchir ici il est bien permis je suppose de fumer sa pipe vous n y voyez aucun inconvénient",
		"il était neuf heures du soir lorsque la chaise fit halte devant une auberge d assez mince apparence",

		"die werke dieses wilhelms aber die ich zu köln gesehen sind dermaßen zart fein scharf und lebendig daß man schier glauben sollte sie seien von händen der engel gemacht und erbebet man bei ihrem anblick weil sie zu leben scheinen und doch nicht leben",
		"da ich nun in den garten gekommen war den ich vorher auch noch nicht gesehen denn mein gnädiger herr und ritter war den abend spät mit mir angekommen und ich im finstern in mein stüblein gebracht worden konnte ich vor staunen und betrachten der neuen dinge um mich her auch nicht zum gebete kommen",
		"leg es in linnen die du gewebt zu blumen die du gepflücket stirb mit daß wenn es die äuglein hebt im himmel es dich erblicket",
		"da küßte sie der vater und ging fort",
		"brichts nicht in freud brichts doch in leid bricht es uns allen beiden",
		"doch habe ich noch eine gabe deren ich euch genießen lassen will und die ihr mir nicht so leicht einholen sollet denn sie ist rasch und fliehet davon auch werdet ihr sie mit allem ernste nicht leicht verdrängen mögen denn sie ist lieblich und lustig anzuschauen und könnte ich sie euch wirklich zu eigen geben so würdet ihr sie nicht gerne wieder lassen eine also gute gesellin ist sie",
		"mir ist als träume ich ich flöge",
		"mein herr der sehr ernst geworden war sagte hierauf traurig vor sich niederschauend und was ist das vor ein kleinod johannes mit dem du so prahlest",
		"nach einigen stunden erwachte ich und sah eine schöne edle frau vor mir stehen ein diener führte ihr roß auf welchem ihr söhnlein saß und war sie abgestiegen als sie mich so allein im wilden walde liegen sah",
		"ich schau zu dir so tag als nacht muß ewig zu dir schauen du mußt mir die mich zur welt gebracht auch nun die wiege bauen",
		"als ich das lied ganz hergesagt waren ich und mein herr ritter ein bißchen stille",
		"links stand der mond noch blaß am himmel und rechts war der himmel wie das lauterste gold",
		"da ich so eine weile nach ihm hingesehen hatte wendete er die augen zufällig zu dem orte an dem ich stand und redete mich freundlich an mit den worten wie ist dir johannes daß du so stille dastehest",
		"er ist zu gott gegangen vor zehn jahren und liegt begraben auf dem kirchhofe zu kloster arnstein",
		"aber was ich da zuletzt gesprochen hatte war wohl töricht und ein schlechter anfang meiner versprochenen erfreulichen reden denn mein gnädiger herr ward nun sehr stille und finster",
		"nun klang das glöcklein und der fromme liebreiche herr trat mit dem ministranten zum altar und las uns die heilige messe selbst mit großer andacht",
		"da ich nun nach solchem gebete einen merklichen trost in meinem herzen spürte nahm ich ein gülden gewirktes band worauf das ave maria stand aus meinem gebetbüchlein und hängte es durch das gitter langend dem bilde der jungfrau maria über den arm als das opfer eines törichten menschen der vor ihrem sohne betend trost gefunden hatte",
		"amen",
		"ich aber redete leise zu füßen des bettes mutter darf ich zu dir kommen",
		"da rief ich komm lieb mutter komm",
		"gewiß sagte die mutter wenn die so es tun sich so lieben wie wir aber den lieben gott doch noch viel mehr als einander und wenn in der kirche alle leute zusammen beten und der priester am altare betet da ist das gebet des priesters die hand in die sie alle ihre hände gefalten haben",
		"wer da",
		"auch sollst du nicht traurig sein um des leides willen das dich auf erden treffen wird nein nur um deine und aller schuld deren strafe das leid ist",
		"ach möchten nur alle ihre hände in des heilands hand in die gott alles gegeben hat glaubend hoffend und liebend legen dann würden wir alle zusammen schauen in das angesicht gottes",
		"lieber johannes sprach sie hierauf ich mache dir immer das kreuz und küsse dich wenn ich schlafen gehe daß dir gottes und deiner mutter segen in der nacht zugute komme aber du hast bisher immer schon geschlafen wenn ich es tat und wußtest es darum nicht",
		"wenn du fromm und fleißig bist kannst du mit der zeit diese meine bilder besitzen und abt sein wenn ich in dem stillen konvent unter der kirche schlafe",
		"in solchen betrachtungen wollte ich wieder nach dem sommerhäuslein gehn sah aber meinen gnädigen herrn und ritter gar tiefsinnig mit gefalteten händen unter einem baume im sonnenschein sitzen und traute nicht ihm vorüberzugehen damit ich ihn nicht störe",
		"wer rufet dir",
		"da meine mutter dies sah fuhr es wie ein blitz durch ihre augen und umarmte sie mich heftig in der kirche aber ihre wangen wurden schamrot und ihre augen voll tränen da ließ sie mich los und senkte das haupt auf den betstuhl",
		"recht sagte die mutter o wie selig wäre die welt wenn alle menschen so vereinet beteten wie wir es heut tun konnten und wie es eine fromme gemeinde in der kirche tut",
		"ich bins",
		"sie aber antwortete ich werde nicht wiederkehren doch werdet ihr mir nachfolgen und da wird alles voll herrlichkeit sein aber hörst du elslein du mußt mir den abschied nicht schwer machen und auch den vater trösten wenn er weinen sollte und ihm erzählen wie ich dir gesagt daß ihr mir nachkommen werdet denn das täublein wird bald kommen mir ist als höre ich schon seinen flügelschlag",
		"das war die opferkerze die uns der herr abt versprochen",
		"schon stand die sonne hoch am himmel und ich war weit von unsrer hütte verirrt aber ich vergaß vor begierde das arzneikraut zu finden meinen hunger und als ich endlich in großer ermüdung niederkniete und mit tränen zu dem lieben jesuskinde betete es möge mir doch das kraut suchen helfen ich wolle ihm auch mein brot schenken bin ich darüber vor müdigkeit entschlafen",
		"elslein ich fliege schon",
		"da küßte ich die mutter und sagte ich will tun wie du willst und will dein gutes elslein sein und die mutter küßte mich wieder mit den worten o du gutes gutes elslein",
		"so nehmt es denn hin wie es ist und füget hinzu was man nicht mitgeben kann",
		"da rief ich wer da",
		"dann aber auch ward mir gegeben viele irdische herrlichkeit und was zum leben nötig und lustig ist denn ich ward gelehret daß der glanz der sonne all mein gold sei der spiegel der flüsse all mein silber die grünen wiesen mit ihren blumen all meine teppiche und tapezereien der himmel mit seinen blauen gestirnten gewölben und der grüne hohe wald alle meine gebäude und hallen ja endlich bin ich so reich geworden daß mir die ganze welt offen stand und alle guten menschen meine diener warden zu denen ich sprechen durfte gib mir dies gib mir jenes und hatte ich auch keinen herrn als den herrn aller herren den lieben gott der mir das leben zu einem leben gegeben und in dessen hände ich es so der heilige geist seine gnade verleiht und mein herr jesus sich meiner erbarmt ohne große makel zurückzugeben hoffe und habe ich mir zum spruche auf mein schild erwählt denn ich bin eines ritters sohn der himmel ist mein hut die erde ist mein schuh das heilge kreuz ist mein schwert wer mich sieht hat mich lieb und wert",
		"so lallt zu dir ein frommes herz und nimmer lernt es sprechen blickt ewig zu dir blickt himmelwärts und will in freuden brechen",
		"so zogen wir still und einsam wohl eine stunde lang durch den dichten wald als wären wir die einzigen menschen auf der welt und hätten nicht viel freude",
		"da zerrann bald all mein leid und meine hoffart vor dem sohne gottes der nackt und arm in einer krippe vor mir lag und dem doch die könige dienten",
		"die gewaltige künstlichkeit des wunderwürdigen münsterturms hätte mich beinahe wieder niedergeschlagen denn ich bedachte mit verwunderung wie ich doch unter den hohen eichen in finstern wäldern auf hohen bergen an steilen abgründen und bei stürzenden wasserfällen in einsamen tälern recht in einöde ja ganz verlassen auch wohl gar hungrig gesessen und mich doch nicht so bewegt gefühlt als bei dem anblick dieses turmes",
		"ach das waren wohl harte und wahre worte meines mänteleins und ich nahm es mit schämen von dem fenster und legte es um über meinen neuen staat und faßte es fest mit den händen um die brust als wollte ich es um verzeihung bitten und ging mit dem gedanken die treppe hinab in den garten wenn ich ein armer fahrender schüler gewesen bin so werde ich immer ein armer fahrender schüler bleiben denn auf erden sind wir alle arm und müssen mannigfach mit unserm leben herumwandeln und lernen und bleiben doch arme schüler bis der herr sich unser erbarmet und uns einführet durch seinen bittern tod in das ewige leben",
		"aber der hunger fing mich an zu drücken und ich bemerkte mit weinen daß ich mein brot nicht mehr in meiner tasche fand",
		"weil ich ihn an sein alter erinnert hatte glaubte ich",
		"da dankte mein vater dem ritter herzlich und sprach so ihr einen armen mann nicht verschmähet will ich euren zuspruch hoch in ehren halten aber ihr müßt dann auch von meiner wasserquelle hier trinken da fließt auch gottes segen drin",
		"ich trat mit scheu hinein denn die wenigen strahlen welche durch die verschlossenen fensterladen fielen zeigten mir allerlei große vögel an den wänden in unbestimmtem lichte",
		"vorwort vor funfzehn jahren machte es mir freude die folgende einfache geschichte niederzuschreiben",
		"dachte ich bei mir und fühlte mich mit ganzer seele zu dem lieben herrn hingezogen",
		"einmal weiß ich daß ich gar sehr weinen mußte als ich sie nachts bei ihrem rocken so vor sich hin singen hörte da fing eine nachtigall vor unserm fenster auch an zu singen es war schon sehr spät und der volle mond schien klar und hell",
		"dachte ich bei mir selbst und schaute zum morgenlichte hin und sprach du bist mein licht du wirst mein tag",
		"ach wiedersehen geht fern und weit und nahe geht das scheiden",
		"da erwiderte ich herr es ist meine jugend deren will ich euch genießen lassen wie ich kann",
		"da sagte ich mein vater hat es gesetzt als ich noch nicht geboren war da er von meiner mutter scheiden mußte und hat sie ihn nie wiedergesehn und kenne ich ihn auch nicht",
		"mein vater lächelte und sagte gnädiger herr ihr habt von dem euren getrunken aber er hat auf einem milden fasse gelegen denn eure liebe frau ida hat diesen trunk meiner seligen agnes zur labung gebracht und wenn er euch besser schmeckt als zu haus so ists weil ihr gottes segen schmecket",
		"da war mir unendlich wohl und meine sehnsucht sie nicht zu ermüden ward so inbrünstig daß ich glaubend fühlte ich ermüde sie nicht und mit ihren haaren spielend zu ihr sagte liebe mutter bin ich nicht recht leicht",
		"da löschte sie die lampe aus und trat vor mein bettlein und machte mir das zeichen des kreuzes auf stirne mund und herz und küßte mich und da ich fühlte daß sie weinte schlang ich meine arme um ihren hals und drückte ihr antlitz fest an das meinige und da weinten wir beide",
		"o meine mutter sagte ich mir wer war sanfter und schöner und feiner und edler als du wer war würdiger zwischen blumen zu wandeln als du die wohl ihre schwester und gespielin sein konnte",
		"es war als sage das mäntelein zu mir o johannes bist du ein so eitler kaufherr daß du angelanget in den hafen des zerrissenen segels vergißt das dich in denselben geführet",
		"und weinte laut",
		"da die messe zu ende war fragte ich meine mutter wieder nach dem steinernen bilde mit den worten mutter was macht denn der alte laurenburger da",
		"ach mutter rief ich aus ist dieses gottes angesicht",
		"wirst du können was der frühling nicht vermag",
		"ja ihr liebes angesicht war wie ein durchsichtiges fensterlein ihres herzens aus dem ihre seele mit jeder innern bewegung errötend und erbleichend zum himmel schaute",
		"davor kniete ich nieder ins gras und betete von ganzem herzen",
		"worauf ich sagte ich will sie das vaterunser beten lehren",
		"da trank der herr und mußte ihm der vater bescheid tun",
		"da nahm die mutter die linnen und gaben wir sie unten dem bruder schneider der hielt aber der mutter den korb zurück bis wir aus der kirche kamen",
		"nun richtete ich mich in meinem bettlein auf und schaute in meinem gemache umher das hatte aber fenster rings herum und war in einem sommerhäuslein des gartens",
		"am folgenden morgen wachte ich früher auf als die mutter",
		"das hatte meinem vater der gute alte laurenburger knecht so geordnet daß er seines leids desto eher vergessen und ein neues leben anfangen möge",
		"besonders aber befremdete es mich daß meine mutter mit allem dem geräte der hütte ganz vertraut war und in der hütte tat als wäre sie immer darin gewesen darum fragte ich sie mit den worten liebe mutter bleiben wir nun hier ist dies auch unser häuslein",
		"ich betrachtete alle diese dinge die ich früher nie gesehen mit bangem staunen während meine mutter auf einem hölzernen stuhle sitzend still dem fenster hinaus nach der laurenburg sah",
		"da sagte sie ja lieb elslein doch steh erst auf und bringe mir das kleine kreuz aus meiner truhe mich verlanget sehr darnach",
		"was heilig in dir zu aller stund das bin ich all gewesen nun küß mich süßer mund gesund weil du an mir genesen",
		"jetzt noch wenn ich bete ist es mir oft als schaute ich nach ihren lippen und spräche ihr nach",
		"nur lust nur lust und gar kein weh ach du trinkst auch die schmerzen so stärke gott in himmelshöh dich herz aus meinem herzen",
		"wir kamen daselbst in des abtes stube die war mit schönen bildern ausgemalt auch handelte der abt selbst um das tuch mit der mutter und war ein heiliger aber sonst gar freundlicher und lustiger mann fragte mich auch da ich die schönen bilder an den wänden so fleißig betrachtete hans dir gefällt wohl meine zelle hast du auch lust ein geistlicher ordensherr zu werden",
		"man fühlet da wohl daß der mensch etwas sein und schaffen kann was viel herrlicher ist als sein gewöhnliches sein und schaffen und man erschrickt darüber daß diese herrlichkeit so fremd und selten ist daher wohl eine menge sprossen auf der leiter zu dieser vollkommenheit wo nicht fehlen doch unsichtbar sein müssen und wir alle wohl tief herunter geworfen sind",
		"ich hatte ihn gestern nicht recht gesehen denn es dunkelte schon da er mich am wege barmherzig zu sich nahm",
		"nun hatte ich den mut nicht mehr nach dem bilde zu schauen und ward mir mein großvater von damals an ein gar ernster und sorglicher gedanke aber ich habe zum ersten male gebetet mit einer recht innerlichen herzensangst wie früher nie warum ich aber so gebetet kann ich mich nicht mehr deutlich entsinnen",
		"da ich die große freundlichkeit meines herrn aus dieser rede vernommen hatte faßte ich einen guten mut setzte mich zu ihm unter den baum und sprach also mein gnädiger herr und ritter es gibt keinen ehrlicheren weg ins leben als die geburt denn unser heiland ist ihn auch gewandelt und so gibt es auch keinen ehrlicheren weg zur armut als in ihr geboren zu sein denn auch unser heiland ward in ihr geboren und so kam ich zur armut als ich zur welt kam",
		"nein mein kind erwiderte sie das ist nur seine erschaffene sonne die er über uns arme sündige menschen scheinen läßt aber denen die ihn lieben hat gott bereitet was kein auge gesehn und kein ohr gehört hat und was in keines menschen herz gekommen ist",
		"es war dies aber ein feines blaues wams um die lenden gefaltet und gestutzet und rot und weißes beinkleid von ländschem tuch auch stumpfe schuh und eine schwarze kogel mit einer blauen feder nicht zu vergessen ein hemmet von weißem hauslinnen am halse bunt genäht und gekrauset dergleichen ich vorher nie getragen",
		"du lachst aus kindesblicken o engelsehen o selge ruh in dich mich zu entzücken",
		"ich habe dieses aber nicht allein bei dem anblick dieses schwindelhohen turmes empfunden sondern auch bei gar lieblichen und feinen werken von welchen ich nur nennen will die überaus feinen und natürlichen gemälde des malers wilhelm in köln der von den meistern als der beste meister in allen deutschen landen geachtet wird denn er malet einen jeglichen menschen von aller gestalt als lebe er",
		"kühl dich in liebeswogen",
		"seit du von mir gefahren singt stets die nachtigall ich denk bei ihrem schall wie wir zusammen waren",
		"da ward es mir fast leicht und fröhlich zumute und hätte ich wohl mögen einen sprung tun als hätte ich einen neuen menschen angezogen mit dem neuen kleide",
		"das wird er gewiß liebes elslein so es dir gut ist sagte die mutter aber wenn ich wieder einschliefe und das täublein käme wieder und ich flöge mit ihm fort so würdest du gewiß gern zurückbleiben bei deinem vater daß er nicht allein sei so ich dich darum bitten würde",
		"nun schied der ritter freundlich von uns mit den seinen und ich ging mit dem vater in unser einsames häuslein worin die mutter nicht mehr war",
		"und ich erwiderte in ewigkeit amen",
		"hernach als meine eltern hier wohnten hielt sich der hirsch immer freundlich zu ihnen und ich weiß noch recht wohl daß er wenn wir aßen den kopf hier zum fenster hereinsteckte und ich als ein kind ihm brot gab",
		"was mir meine selige mutter die schöne laurenburger els in dem häuslein meines seligen großvaters des voglers kilian auf der hirzentreu von sich und dem lieben großvater erzählt hat diese berghöhe heißt die hirzentreu und dieses häuslein worin wir sitzen gehörte meinem lieben seligen vater dem vogelsteller kilian den man weit und breit nur den guten kilian und den frommen falkenmeister nannte",
		"der diener kannte meinen vater gar wohl und lief mit freuden die waldstege nach unsrer hütte zu",
		"o gewiß das können sie erwiderte die mutter und das in unsers lieben erlösers jesus christi hände der überall und an allen orten ist und seine heiligen hände für uns am kreuze ausgespannt hat uns zu erlösen von der sünde",
		"gott gebe daß ich also in ehren grau werden möge",
		"da sagte sie die nachtigall sehnt sich und lobet gott also tue ich auch",
		"ich empfand große bangigkeit um ihre rührende gebärde",
		"nun aber nahm meine mutter linnen das sie gewebt und garn das sie gesponnen und gezwirnet um es in dem kloster zu verkaufen",
		"im jahr da man zählte nach christi unsers lieben herrn geburt am zwanzigsten tage des maimonats hörte ich johannes der schreiber die schwalbe in der frühe an meinem kammerfenster singen und ward innigst von dem morgenlied des frommen vögeleins erbauet bedachte auch auf meinem bettlein wie die schwalbe in daurender freude lebet gegen den winter in ferne wärmere länder ziehet und der heimat getreu gegen den frühling wiederkehrt also nicht der mensch der arme fahrende schüler der wohl viel gegen sturm und wetter ziehen muß ja der oft kein feuer findet die erstarrten hände zu erwärmen daß er sie falte zum gebet aber so er es ernstlich meinet haucht er hinein",
		"was können wir ihm aber anderes antworten als die werke des herrn sind unbegreiflich er treibt uns zu bauen und schaffen über das leben hinaus denn wir waren unsterblich und vollkommen und wir sind gefallen in den tod durch die sünde du turm aber stehe als ein zeuge daß wir dunkel fühlen was wir waren vor dieser zeit und daß wir noch ringen nach unendlichem ziel so stehe du dann als ein träger unsrer mühe und unsrer buße zu ehren unsres heilands und seligmachers jesu christi der uns erlöset hat durch sein bittres leiden und sterben",
		"da versetzte der ritter scherzhaft wenn ich dir nun auch mein herz geben wollte für das deinige so behielt ich doch das wams zugute wie dann johannes",
		"er aber sprach das hast du nicht getan johannes du hast die wahrheit gesprochen aber mir ist schwerer aufs herz gefallen was mir lange schon darauf liegt mein unwert",
		"einstens aber hörte mein vater ihn in der nacht heftig schreien da stand er mit der mutter auf und sie gingen hinaus zu sehen was dem guten tiere fehlte",
		"so lieb ich das gedicht hatte blieb es doch unterbrochen der sinn der leser schien dazu zu fehlen",
		"ich schau zu dir so tag als nacht muß ewig zu dir schauen und wenn mein himmel träumend lacht wächst hoffnung und vertrauen",
		"alle das häusliche wohlgepflegte behagen des schönen ziergartens erfüllte mich mit traurigen gedanken und die armut die einsamkeit meines eigenen lebens trat mir in dieser reichen umgebung zum erstenmal recht lebendig vor die seele",
		"mir aber ist nichts geblieben als deine zucht und ich kann dein nicht gedenken in freuden denn mir gehöret nichts als die armut und ich habe keinen säckel aus dem ich dir das schönste grab könnte erbauen lassen von marmelstein und gold",
		"da trat ein ordensbruder aus der sakristei mit einer schönen bunten wachskerze die zündete er an der ewigen lampe an nahte dann unserm betstuhl und reichte sie meiner mutter und mir zu küssen und als wir dies getan steckte er sie auf st jörgen leuchter der neben st jörgen altar stand und gestaltet war wie eine lanze die durch einen lindwurm gestochen ist",
		"zwischen der arbeit schaute ich oft nach ihr sah auch mit freude wie der anblick der gegend ihr antlitz zu erheitern schien und als ich meine ernte ihr darbot lächelte sie freundlich strich mir mit der hand über die stirne und sagte schönen dank johannes du bist ein gutes kind",
		"eine fromme klosterfrau meiner selgen mutter befreundte hatte es mir einst für ein lied das ich ihr gedichtet und gesungen geschenket und war es zu marburg an st elisabethen grab angerühret worden ich aber hatte es bisher als einen blattzeiger in meinem gebetbüchlein geführet",
		"der tag brach an und ich nahm ein zweiglein von dem rosmarienstock der bei ihrem lager stand und gab es ihr zu dem kreuze in ihre gefaltenen hände",
		"dieses band aber war mir das liebste was ich hatte",
		"aber ich bin doch nicht lang arm geblieben denn ich fand eine unaussprechlich liebe mutter die ließ mich an ihrem herzen schlummern und sah auf mich nieder mit sorgenden liebesblicken und weckte sie mich nicht mit ihren tränlein die auf mich niederfielen so weckte sie mich mit küssen und ließ mich ihr eignes leben aus ihren brüsten trinken o herr war ich nicht reich wer ist reicher als ein neugebornes kindlein ja ich war so reich daß ich meiner lieben mutter freud und leid verdoppeln konnte was ihr wohl aus einem liede vernehmen werdet das meine mutter oft sang wenn sie mich in frühster jugend einschläferte und habe ich es nach ihrem tode in ihrem gebetbüchlein liegend gefunden es ist aber gestellt bald als rede ein kindlein zur mutter bald die mutter zu ihm nun höret o mutter halte dein kindlein warm die welt ist kalt und helle und trag es fromm in deinem arm an deines herzens schwelle",
		"hernach kam die edelfrau von der laurenburg mit ihrem söhnlein dem junker jörg über die lahn zur hirzentreu wie sie den abend vorher mir versprochen und derselbe alte diener war wieder bei ihr",
		"komm her komm her trink meine brust leben von meinem leben o könnt ich alle fromme lust aus meiner brust dir geben",
		"da träumt mir wie ich so ganz allein gewohnt dir unterm herzen da waren die freuden die leiden dein mir freuden auch und schmerzen",
		"ich verstand sie nicht und suchte ihr das kreuzlein in dem bette das ihren händen entfallen war und legte es ihr wieder in die hände mit den worten herzmutter da ist der liebe heiland",
		"wie arm ich bin darf ich zu dir doch kommen die mängel hat dein treuer sinn ja all von mir genommen",
		"nun gingen wir durch eine kleine gerätlose küche in eine viereckte stube",
		"wohlan es zielt des todes pfeil er wird mich nicht verderben zu deinen wunden herr ich eil da werd ichs leben erben",
		"erst nach mancherlei proben und prüfungen ward ihm enthüllet was der geheiligte kreis seltsam in bildern verbarg",
		"schleichend eilt ich hinaus",
		"schnitter sind es sie ziehn wieder nach hause zurück weit hinweg",
		"nun eil ich und fürcht euch nicht zu beleidgen denn ihr stolzen ihr gebt amorn doch immer den rang",
		"anfangs lachte sie nur masken ihr götter sind das",
		"träum ich",
		"denkst du nun wieder zu bilden freund",
		"schwer erhalten wir uns den guten namen denn fama steht mit amorn ich weiß meinem gebieter in streit",
		"sie ergötzt sich an ihm dem freien rüstigen fremden der von bergen und schnee hölzernen häusern erzählt teilt die flammen die sie in seinem busen entzündet freut sich daß er das gold nicht wie der römer bedenkt",
		"so verfolgte das liedchen malbrough den reisenden briten einst von paris nach livorn dann von livorno nach rom weiter nach napel hinunter und wär er nach smyrna gesegelt malbrough",
		"einst erschien sie auch mir ein bräunliches mädchen die haare fielen ihr dunkel und reich über die stirne herab kurze locken ringelten sich ums zierliche hälschen ungeflochtenes haar krauste vom scheitel sich auf",
		"irrte die schöne",
		"ich muß ihn dir geben und den höheren stil lehret die liebe dich nur also sprach der sophist",
		"einem dichter zuliebe verkürze die herrlichen stunden die mit begierigem blick selig der maler genießt glühend blicke noch schnell zu diesen hohen fassaden kuppeln und säulen zuletzt und obelisken herauf stürze dich eilig ins meer um morgen früher zu sehen was jahrhunderte schon göttliche lust dir gewährt diese feuchten mit rohr so lange bewachsnen gestade diese mit bäumen und busch düster beschatteten höhn",
		"siehe dir bin ich nun gar nach rom gefolget",
		"und noch schöner von heut an seid mir gegrüßet ihr schenken osterien wie euch schicklich der römer benennt denn ihr zeiget mir heute die liebste begleitet vom oheim den die gute so oft mich zu besitzen betrügt",
		"welche seligkeit ists",
		"wenig hütten zeigten sie erst dann sahst du auf einmal sie vom wimmelnden volk glücklicher räuber belebt",
		"diese kleider sie sind der neidischen nachbarin zeugen daß die witwe nicht mehr einsam den gatten beweint",
		"noch betracht ich kirch und palast ruinen und säulen wie ein bedächtiger mann schicklich die reise benutzt",
		"und so bin ich denn auch am ende betrogen",
		"darum macht faustine mein glück sie teilet das lager gern mit mir und bewahrt treue dem treuen genau",
		"als daß demeter die große sich gefällig einmal auch einem helden bequemt als sie jasion einst dem rüstigen könig der kreter ihres unsterblichen leibs holdes verborgne gegönnt",
		"denn er bellte mir einst mein mädchen an da sie sich heimlich zu mir stahl und verriet unser geheimnis beinah",
		"und der alte war so hahnrei und hielt sie nur fester",
		"aber heute verweile mir nicht und wende die blicke von dem siebengebirg früher und williger ab",
		"o wer flüstert mir zu an welchem fenster erblick ich einst das holde geschöpf das mich versengend erquickt",
		"ehret wen ihr auch wollt",
		"und bin ich etwa nicht schuldig",
		"empfing ihn auch dort malbrough",
		"morgen frühe geschäftig verläßt sie das lager der liebe weckt aus der asche behend flammen aufs neue hervor",
		"welch ein freudig erwachen erhieltet ihr ruhige stunden mir das denkmal der lust die in den schlaf uns gewiegt",
		"jeder reisende klagt er finde schlechte bewirtung welchen amor empfiehlt köstlich bewirtet ist er",
		"sind zwei liebende doch sich ein versammeltes volk",
		"wein floß über den tisch und sie mit zierlichem finger zog auf dem hölzernen blatt kreise der feuchtigkeit hin",
		"wenn das volk mich verklagt ich muß es dulden",

		"amor schüret die lamp indes und gedenket der zeiten da er den nämlichen dienst seinen triumvirn getan",
		"und jung und wohlbekannt den verführern falconieri hat mir oft in die augen gegafft und ein kuppler albanis mich mit gewichtigen zetteln bald nach ostia bald nach den vier brunnen gelockt",
		"laß sie noch einmal besehn",
		"und leider bin ich zu folgen gewöhnt wenn der gebieter befiehlt",
		"aber die übrige welt verschmachtete denn es versäumte über der liebe genuß ceres den schönen beruf",

		"daß es aber um weihnachten und johannis in der nacht aus dem see klingt als wenn glocken in den kirchen geläutet werden das ist wahr und viele leute haben es gehört und auch mein vater",
		"und anderhalb stunden nach des dieners ausflug waren beide in boldewitz und fanden den alten herrn auf dem lager blaß und bleich wie den tod und sein weib und seine kinder um ihn welche ihm seine wunden verbunden hatten",
		"warum ging vielmehr trinens wirtschaft von tage zu tage mehr zurück",
		"nun begab es sich lange nach diesen tagen daß in bergen ein könig von rügen wohnte der hatte eine wunderschöne tochter die hieß svanvithe und sie war die schönste prinzessin weit und breit und es kamen könige und fürsten und prinzen aus allen landen die um die schöne prinzessin warben",
		"wat helpt uns all din stilles lewen un din stiernkieken wenn du nich up de riksschelme kikst",
		"und bei diesen worten machte der gärtner christian eine gar absonderliche und verwunderliche miene",
		"un jeden oogenblick dachte he hu",
		"un all sine minister un rathsherren kleedden sick apisch in bunten röcken de van swerem golde un sülwer tor erde sleepten un ook sinen drabanten un soldaten dheed he de buntesten un prächtigsten kleeder an und gaff en jeden mand nüe un schönere mundering",
		"denn das mußte man sagen einen aufgeräumteren menschen gab es nicht als diese bäuerin und kein haus hatte so viel lustigkeit als das ihrige",
		"äwerst nu was ehr spill vörbi un nüms kunn ehr helpen se müßte jämmerlich verbrennen denn se was in ehre egne kunst geraden un in ehr egne smeer fallen",
		"geladen seid ihr allzugleich der könig ziehet durch sein reich",
		"dittmal krigst du eenen mann un wat för eenen mann",
		"denn er lebt wie ein sehr vornehmer herr und der großmogul und könig von frankreich kann keine bessere tage haben und die königin von antiochien hat sie nicht gehabt die ihr vermögen in herzen von paradiesvögeln und gehirnen von nachtigallen aufgefressen hat",
		"willkommen meine süße braut",
		"er sprang nun zu und half ihr wieder aus dem wasser und stellte sich als sey er unschuldig an der sache greinte und grieflachte aber in sich",
		"ick vörstah ook eene kunst un hew een stückschen van eenem bunten vägelken singen hürt dat jümmer in minem gården piept",
		"weil sie aber in ihren einsamen trauerstunden zeit genug hatte hin und her zu denken so fiel ihr die sache ein von dem königsschatze unter dem garzer walle die sie in ihrer kindheit oft gehört hatte und sie gedachte damit ihre unschuld und daß der polnische prinz sie unter einem falschen schein schändlich belogen hatte sonnenklar zu beweisen",
		"so klang es im feierlichen und langsamen gesange fort und dann schallten immer wieder einzelne kreischende und gellende stimmen mit widerlichem laute darunter birlibi",
		"aber weiter als den garten konnte sie nicht kommen denn es lief eine himmelhohe krystallene mauer rings um ihn herum und seine thore waren dicht verschlossen",
		"un dom stund nu wedder sichtbar då un juchte datt de ganze hoff vör froiden schallde",
		"un hier müßt ridder dom noch eenen harden strid bestahn mit twee löwen de den hoff bewachten un mit eenem riesen de an der slottsport stund un keenen minschen inlet de nich een teken van dem draken hedd",
		"piep",
		"himmel du spreckst eene to dütliche sprack mit mi ick bün de dom un ick will de dom bliwen un mit gottes hülp alles utfechten",
		"wif",
		"hierauf habe ich nun meine hoffnung eines neuen glückes gestellt ob es mir etwa aufblühen wolle laß mich denn herr könig mit gott diese probe machen",
		"un he wull em een grotes geleide gewen datt he as een fürst to dem platz henriden kunn wo de bier gewöhnlich lag",
		"un et wurd een grot geschrei un veele schippers lepen herbi un ook schipper gau",
		"auch pastor manthey ist inne geworden daß er gegen die losen und leichten künste der thrin sich nicht mit der gehörigen geistlichen rüstung gewaffnet hatte und daß sie an ihn durfte er hat bemerkt daß ihm ein dieb an seine schinken und würste kam und das ist auch die thrin gewesen",
		"he unnerstund sick wat keen anner schipper dörfte un se seden he kunn mit allen winden segeln un wenn he wull ook wedder den strom",
		"denn de lüde munkelden so wat van eenem blanken käwer edder eener grönen pogg in eenem glase un dat was sin puk de em den wind un dat glück makte un de matrosen wullen dat düwelsche ding unnerwielen sehn hebben wenn t stief weihde edder de nacht gefährlich düster was wo t as een lütt winzig jüngiken in eener swarten jacke eene rode mütz up m kopp up dem schipp herümleep un alles nahsach edder ook as een old gris männiken mit eener kritwitten parück up dem kopp dat am stürroder satt un in den häwen keek un dem schipp den weg wisde",
		"und als es kaum dämmerte und das licht noch furchtsam durch die vorhänge in die zimmer guckte rief er seine männer auf und es ward ein laufen und wimmeln im schloßhofe daß die königin und die prinzessin darob erwachten und mit staunen und schrecken vernahmen daß klas wieder auf seine schiffe wolle",
		"ach",
		"aber die stiefmutter dachte ganz anders in ihrem sinn als sie sich gebehrdete und sprach ich will spielleute bestellen die sollen zu einem andern tanze aufspielen und die füße sollen anderswohin tanzen als ins brautbett",
		"un so is wat anfangs as een spaß utsach de gröteste ernst worden",
		"jochen lachte unbändig auf als sie gesungen hatte und rief das ist ja ein dummes närrisches lied alte ohne sinn und verstand",
		"un de olde hex sprack to em min leewe fründ ick hew sehr unrecht dhan an di un an mi datt ick di den schönsten stärksten mann van mi laten wull",
		"to m hochtidsdanze",
		"jakob war kaum hundert schritt fort so kam der schlangenkönig über den see geschwommen und ringelte sich dann in den allerlustigsten kreisen über die wiesen hin und machte so viele niedliche schlingungen und windungen und richtete sein köpfchen mit der goldenen krone so lieblich lächelnd und so hell guckend auf daß die kleine margarethe recht ihre freude daran hatte und ihr versprechen das sie jakob gethan auch ganz und gar vergaß",
		"und hieb mit der axt um sich und hieb sie alle vier nieder daß auch kein lebenszeichen in ihnen blieb",
		"darup müßte he alles recht utführlich vörtellen wo he mit dem undeerd fardig worden was un he makte de geschicht van siner slacht mit dem bier lustig nog torecht",
		"denn gewöhnlich jagt er was er vor seine peitsche kriegt so lange bis es die zunge aus dem halse streckt und todt hinfällt",
		"awerst as de erdtüffeln herut nahmen weren ging de försterfru hen un seiede blomensaat up der stell un as se sach datt de hahn dat bekrassede jog se en weg",
		"un he gaff em den ring un dom stack en an sinen finger",
		"du kühner klas",
		"juchhe hochtid",
		"denn klas war bei allen seinen großen thaten immer seiner jugend eingedenk geblieben und war immer herzlich demüthig und klein vor gott dem er allein alles beimaaß von seiner eigenen ritterlichkeit und schönheit die wohl die herzen aller weiber der welt anlocken konnte wußte er gar nichts",
		"darüm steit da herüm ook jümmer dat schönste un längste gras denn dat veh müßt den verstand verlaren hebben dat da mit egnem willen gräsen gahn wull un ick glöw keen dummer dreihhals van schaap edder goos würd da een halmken anrühren",
		"und peter setzte den buben wieder auf den boden sah zornig und ging stumm und verdrießlich aus der thüre",
		"un lat di dat erste halwe jåhr nich merken datt du een snider büst denn de schelms de schohknechte künnen di nahspören",
		"du willst das heilige kreuz du willst das christenthum du willst die christen hier wieder verlassen und sie wieder auf des schwerdtes spitze stellen",
		"hebben ridder nich löwen un tigern de tehnen utbraken un ick schull vör eenen bier torügg bäwern",
		"ja woll",
		"da ist es ihm denn geschehen daß er eines abends als er mit einem schweren bündel und noch schwereren hupupp",
		"und so ist in den städten und dörfern welche der förster fritz besuchte mancherlei gerede entstanden zugleich von verwegenen dieben und von wohltätigen engeln wie denn gottes reich und satans reich und die gespräche darüber hier auf erden immer mitsammen sind",
		"ich habe weder lust noch veranlassung gehabt seinem ursprunge diplomatisch nachzuforschen",
		"aber daß sie sich über alles liebten das ist wahr",
		"un toletzt glöwden se he were in een water fallen un vörunglückt edder een wulf edder anner undeerd hedd en terreten",
		"dat was een deerd",
		"da muß der böse feind ihn als irrlicht hineingelockt haben denn er braucht solche künste gegen die welche sich mit ihm einlassen und ihn suchen",
		"und konrad ist groß und stark geworden wie könig klas aber nicht so mächtig und herrlich vor der welt sondern ist als dorfschulze gestorben was sein großvater peter auch gewesen",
		"als schlangenkönig sie über das wasser nach der insel hinübergetragen hatte war er plötzlich verschwunden die kleine margarethe aber war vor angst ohnmächtig geworden und wußte gar nicht wie sie über den see gekommen war",
		"un de löwen kemen ook un lagerden sick nich wiet van em as een schutz wenn de fiend etwa keme den riksdag antofallen un to vörstüren denn se hapten wedder eenen köning ut den ehrigen to maken",
		"und seine mutter und andere freunde haben ihn dort beredet er solle auf dem lande bleiben welchem gott feste balken untergelegt hat und das unstäte und unsichere meer verlassen",
		"in olden tiden as de heiden hier utdrewen un gotts wurt un dat bloodige krütz predigt wurden was disse gegend hier üm starkow redbaß un löbnitz nicks as holt heid un morast wo hier un dar een mann in sinem hüsken wahnde",
		"und jakob ging flugs in den wald und hieb sich einen großen knotigen dornstock aus einem dornstrauch welcher der kreuzdorn heißt und darauf schnitt er noch ein kreuz aus",
		"die alte frau dankte ihm noch und ließ sich nichts merken zog ihre nassen kleider aus und hing sie an sträuchen auf daß sie an der sonne trockneten und fing dann an damit sie sich die langeweile vertriebe mit beweglicher und kläglicher stimme einige lieder zu singen",
		"da erinnerte er sich des märchens vom rattenkönig birlibi das er oft gehört hatte und er dachte willst mal hingehen und zusehen was es ist",
		"dies ist aber der rabenstein und auf folgende weise wird er gewonnen die raben krähen adler und andre solche vögel welche scharfe schnäbel und klauen haben und von gott auf den raub angewiesen sind sagen die leute werden sehr alt und leben wohl zweihundert und dreihundert jahre also viel länger als die ältesten menschen",
		"se hebben regiert as wenn de leewe herrgott im himmel dem bösen de vulle macht gewen hedd den ganzen heelen fluch uttoseien den de herr in sinem grimm spraken hedd as he adam un eva ut dem gården eden jagde",
		"un de olde hertog was een schelm un settede sick up dat hoge perd un sede ja ick hew di t vörspraken dat will ick nich lögnen äwerst ick dachte du werest en prinz un wer weet ob du een goder eddelmann büst un een hertog van swawen kann sine dochter nich jedem ersten besten tolöper gewen",
		"und als jakob ihn so traurig sah jammerte ihn seines schicksals und daß er in dem scheußlichen schlangenrock gehen mußte wegen seiner früheren sünden und schulden bis ein unschuldiges junges blut sich über ihn erbarmte und ihn lieb hätte",
		"un ick red wieder un red an dem groten nil een stück weges hen",
		"diese ward in wenigen wochen mit großer herrlichkeit gefeiert und die schöne prinzessin nahm klas avenstaken zum mann der hinfort könig klas von jütland hieß",
		"nu bün ick een prinz",
		"winkst du erhabenste un holdseligste datt ick de glücklichste van allen kreaturen sin schall de up gotts erdboden lewen",
		"un nu will n wi sehn wo t mit dem steen utsüht",
		"sie aber ward noch viel böser als gestern und jagte ihn mit schlimmen worten fort",
		"und schlangenkönig schüttelte zweimal mit dem kopfe",
		"denn jede kreatur weet darüm un wahrschuwt datt et da nich richtig is",
		"die leute haben aber geglaubt daß der böse feind ihn geholt habe wegen der vielen verruchten und gottlosen streiche die der übermüthige junge immer verübte",
		"andere die dies lustige leben so mit ansahen meinten es gehe nicht mit natürlichen dingen zu sie habe umgang und gemeinschaft mit bösen geistern und die bringen es ihr alles ins haus und geben ihrem vieh und ihren früchten so wunderbaren segen und gedeihen als wenn gott nicht der beste und einzige segenbringer und segensprecher wäre",
		"da ward jakob sehr böse und ging hin und schnitt sich einen frischen haselstock und sprach ich muß wohl einmal dein buntes jäckchen fragen was das zu dem scherze sagt vielleicht giebt mir das eine gescheidtere antwort",
		"doch zitterden se vör dem kampf mit dem riesen",
		"denn überhaupt sind wenige raben in der welt und von diesen wenigen wie wenige werden hundert jahre alt oder gar zweihundert und dreihundert",
		"will he mi in sinem slott sehn so late he mi in eene harbarg führen un mi ridderliche kleeder wapen un een stridroß bringen as mines glieken geziemlich un gebürlich is un knapen un knechte tom deenst damit ick in ridderlicher årt un rüstung in sine borg inriden kann",
		"ohne geld möge er sich nur nicht einbilden daß ein mensch könig werden könne was der einfältige valentin ihm vorgefabelt habe",
		"datt allen lüden een schrecken un vörstaunen ankam",
		"morgen is ook een dag un glück is glückes moder",
		"das ist aber seine strafe daß er so rundlaufen muß wann andere leute in den betten und gräbern schlafen weil er so geizig gewesen ist",
		"denn als es zwölf geschlagen hatte tönte der ganze wald mit einem male wie von trommeln und pauken und pfeifen und trompeten und es war so hell darin als ob er plötzlich von vielen tausend lampen und kerzen erleuchtet worden wäre",
		"vörnehm dörst du nich erschienen denn markt se unrath",
		"so sprack he mit sick sülwst swung sick up sin roß un red wieder dör den dicken wold ahne to weten wohen bet de sinkende nacht ehren swarten mantel äwer de erd deckte",
		"reep dom vörbitterd ick bün ut so godem un düchtigem holt wassen worut man hertöge diner årt woll to dutzenden sniden kunn un wenn du nich den mantel van dem kaiser drögst un nich hertog werst un vader der prinzessin dietlinde ick wull di minen goden stammboom und mine ridderschaft mit dem isen in t gesicht malen un der ganzen welt wiesen wat in minem lande gelöfte gelden",
		"sie haben die geschichte in der stadt erzählt und die leute sind hingegangen aber die beiden dirnen haben sie nimmer gefunden",
		"een schalk de sick äwer meister scharpsteker erlustigen wull hedd et bi dem poeten bestellt un em een paar daler dåvör gewen",
		"un nu wüßte de richter keenen annern rat he hölt den wewer woll för eenen deef äwerst he kunn em t nich up t lif seggen un darüm müßt he en tom swur laten",

		"un he antwurd te ja gnädige frau un stund ter stund vör ehr",
		"denn wer hängen will seggt dat sprickwurt de kan woll dör eenen spennenfaden to doode kamen",
		"die reise war aber nicht weit von bergen nach garz und sie ging in der tracht eines reiterbuben einher",

		"holofernes un alexander un mitderdat",
		"und er war einige stunden am strome so in gedanken fortgeschlendert und hatte nicht gemerkt daß das wasser zunahm",

		"alles was geschehen konnte war daß der feuertod zu dem sie verurteilt wurde zur großen entrüstung der matronen und jungfrauen von st jago durch einen machtspruch des vizekönigs in eine enthauptung verwandelt ward",

		"die dämmerung war schon stark hereingebrochen",
		"nichts anne lene sagte ich aber gib mir deine hand ich hatte das meer vergessen da hörte ich es plötzlich",
		"von dem ackerstück an welchem wir vorüberkamen vernahm man die kurzen laute der brachvögel die unsichtbar in den furchen lagen mitunter flog ein kiebitz schreiend vor uns auf und auf den weiden stand das vieh in dunkeln unkenntlichen massen beisammen wir hatten auf dem rückwege als geschehe es im einverständnis kein wort miteinander gewechselt als wir schon fast im dunkeln auf der werfte angelangt waren ergriff anne lene meine hand",
		"hier waren wir auf unserm alten spielplatz es waren noch dieselben büsche zwischen denen wir einst als kinder in die irre gegangen waren nur hingen ihre zweige noch tiefer in den weg als damals",
		"sie richtete sich auf und sah mich an als müsse sie erst nachsinnen über diese frage",
		"aber du verträgst es nicht",
		"wir betraten diese räume mit einer lüsternen neugierde obgleich wir wußten daß nichts darin zu sehen sei als die halberloschenen tapeten und etwa in dem einen seitenzimmer das leere bettgestell der verstorbenen besitzer",
		"nimm dich in acht claus peters tanzt schon den zweiten tanz mit ihr",
		"das gehöfte war einst neben vielen andern in besitz der nun gänzlich ausgestorbenen familie van der roden aus der während der beiden letzten jahrhunderte eine reihe von pfennigmeistern und ratmännern der landschaft und bürgermeistern meiner vaterstadt hervorgegangen sind neunzig höfe so hieß es hatten sie gehabt und sich im übermut vermessen das hundert voll zu machen",
		"liebe anne lene sagte ich ich bin eben angekommen ich wollte dich noch heute sehen",
		"ich suchte allerlei gespräch aber keines wollte gelingen",
		"nur zur rückkehr nach der stadt vermochte ich sie nicht zu bewegen",
		"fragte sie und suchte dabei in ihrer stimme vergebens eine innere unruhe zu verbergen",
		"aber diese vertrat ihr den weg",
		"sie sah dabei fast mitleidig auf ihre kleinen hände deren schönheit sie der not des lebens opfern wollte",
		"anne lene knüpfte ihr schnupftuch um den kopf dann gingen wir wie wir es oft getan um die ecke des hauses und über die werfte nach dem baumgarten zu",
		"sonst habe ich niemals einen schmuck an ihr gesehen",
		"sage ich und hebe meine kleinen finger auf",
		"aber anne lene erwiderte oh gute wieb es schadet nicht ich weiß das besser als der doktor",
		"mir ist aus jenen stunden noch jeder kleine umstand gegenwärtig ich glaube noch durch die fensterscheibe der altmodischen haustür das mondlicht zu sehen das draußen wie schnee auf den steinfliesen vor dem hause lag im heraustreten hörten wir drinnen in der gesindestube die alte wieb den schrank verschließen in welchem sie das brautlinnen ihres lieblingskindes aufgespeichert hatte es war eine laue nacht über unsern köpfen surrten die nachtschmetterlinge die den erleuchteten fenstern des oberen stockwerks zuflogen die luft war ganz von jenem süßen duft durchwürzt den in der warmen sommerzeit die wolligen blütenkapseln der roten himbeere auszuströmen pflegten",
		"die tür war nur angelehnt",
		"der alte machte anstalt hinabzuklimmen aber der reiter lachte und gab seinem pferde die sporen",
		"so verging die zeit anne lene war ehe ich mich dessen versehen ein erwachsenes mädchen geworden während ich noch kaum zu den jungen menschen zählte",
		"ich war von dem herrn kammerjunker als ein junger bürgerlicher mensch von vornherein mit einer mir sehr empfindlichen oberflächlichkeit behandelt worden er hatte in meiner gegenwart in der regel getan als ob ich gar nicht vorhanden sei was aber das schlimmste war ich hatte zu bemerken geglaubt daß er meiner jungen freundin nicht in gleichem grade wie mir mißfallen hatte",
		"obwohl seit jahren keine pflegende hand dort gewaltet so wuchs doch alles in der größten üppigkeit durcheinander und mittags in der schwülen sommerzeit wenn jasmin und kaprifolien blühten lag die alte heuberg wie im duft begraben anne lene und ich drangen gern aufs geratewohl in diesen blütenwald hinein um uns den reiz eines gefahrlosen irregehens zu verschaffen und nicht selten glückte es daß wir uns nach der feuchten laube im winkel des gartens hinzuarbeiten meinten und statt dessen unerwartet vor dem alten pavillon standen welcher jetzt zur zeitweisen aufbewahrung von sommerfrüchten diente",
		"diese vorfälle welche damals bei der kurz danach erfolgten abreise des kammerjunkers bald von mir vergessen waren ließen nun nicht ab mich zu beunruhigen bis sie endlich von den leiden und freuden des studentenlebens aufs neue in den hintergrund gedrängt wurden",
		"wir werden hereingerufen und da ich zögere nimmt meine mutter einen zuckerkringel aus dem silbernen kuchenkorb und zeigt mir den",
		"aber ihre gedanken schienen nicht bei diesem willkommen zu sein denn sie wandte die augen sogleich wieder von mir ab und begann auf dem fußsteige weiterzugehen",
		"der mond schien auf anne lenes kleine hand die ruhig in der meinen lag",
		"späterhin mögen die männer wie es dort gebräuchlich ist zur besichtigung der rinder auf das land hinausgegangen sein denn ich habe die erinnerung als sei bald eine stille um mich gewesen in der ich nur die sanfte stimme meiner mutter und andre frauenstimmen hörte",
		"ich aber bin niemals wieder dort gewesen",
		"so verließ ich sie an diesem abend aber ich ging von nun an häufig den weg über die fennen nach dem staatshof anne lene schien ihr versprechen halten zu wollen ich fand sie mehrere male beim sahnen in der milchkammer oder am butterfasse wo sie abwechselnd mit der alten wieb den stempel führte ja sie ließ es sich nicht nehmen die butter zum kneten in die mulde zu tun ganz wie sie es von ihrer alten wärterin gesehen hatte sie schien es auch nicht zu merken daß diese hinterher ganz im geheim die letzte hand an ihre arbeit legte",
		"es ist das sogenannte vierkant worin ich mich befinde",
		"willst du nicht kommen marx",
		"der alte knurrte etwas vor sich hin aber er tat doch wie ihm geheißen und bald ritt peters im galopp zum tore hinaus",
		"ihr gesicht trug dabei einen solchen ausdruck von trostlosigkeit daß ich unwillkürlich ausrief anne lene was treibst du da",
		"wir haben sie dann endlich auch gefunden die augen waren zu und die kleine hand war fest geschlossen",
		"da ich in das boskett an der nördlichen seite kam bemerkte ich daß anne lene noch licht in ihrem zimmer habe",
		"ich wollte anne lene sehen aber ich sah sie nicht",
		"ich war es wohl zufrieden",
		"mit diesen worten trat sie in die haustür und bald hörte ich wie sie die treppe nach ihrem zimmer hinaufging",
		"laß mich hier marx solange es mir noch gestattet ist aber komm oft einmal heraus zu uns",
		"das gespräch der beiden älteren herren hatte sich mittlerweile auf städtische angelegenheiten gewandt welche für den fremden wenig interessen boten",
		"o anne lene rief ich und trat auf die stufen die zu dem pavillon führten ich ich hole sie",
		"oho anne lene",
		"seine blanken augen waren ganz in dies geschäft vertieft",
		"anne lene und ich spielten unter dem tische zu ihren füßen wir legten den kopf auf den fußboden und horchten nach dem wasser hinunter",
		"claus peters spielt wohl schon den herrn im staatshof",
		"das haus war auf einer mäßig hohen werfte nach der weise des landes gebaut eine sogenannte heuberg in welcher die wohnungs und wirtschaftsräume unter einem dache vereinigt sind aber die graft welche sich ringsumher zog war besonders breit und tief und der weitläufige garten der innerhalb derselben die gebäude umgab war vorzeiten mit patrizischem luxus angelegt",
		"claus peters trat an den tisch schenkte ihm das glas voll und stieß mit ihm an",
		"nun soll gar der hof verkauft werden nicht meinetwegen marx nicht meinetwegen marten und ich helfen uns schon durch die übrigen paar jahre",
		"ich begab mich zu den alten hofleuten die in gesellschaft des boten am warmen ofen bei ihrem abendtee saßen",
		"noch sehr wohl erinnere ich mich wie das geläute der glocken die gedämpfte redeweise in der alle die schwarzen leute miteinander verkehrten und die kolossalen florbehangenen wachskerzen welche brennend vor dem sarge hinausgetragen wurden ein angenehmes feiertagsgefühl in mir erregten das dem unwillkürlichen grauen vor diesem gepränge vollkommen die waage hielt",
		"ich habe heute keine lust zu spielen",
		"erwiderte peters indem er der kleinen juliane die hand bot und sich mit ihr an die spitze der tanzkolonne stellte",
		"es schien alles still darinnen",
		"gute nacht marx sagte sie verzeih mir ich bin müde ich muß schlafen nicht wahr du kommst recht bald einmal wieder zu uns heraus",
		"willst du mit mir tanzen",
		"den alten ehelauten auf dem hofe war im unteren stock des hauses ein früher von der familie bewohntes zimmer zur benutzung angewiesen allein sie bewohnten nach eigener wahl nach wie vor das gesindezimmer da dieses mit dem stall und den übrigen wirtschaftsräumen in verbindung stand",
		"dann sagte sie langsam ich weiß es nicht das ist auch einerlei",
		"ja wenn wir musik hätten",
		"hier bin ich ja",
		"fuhr sie fort wie zu sich selber redend",
		"die alte wieb mußte den großen kaffeekessel hervorsuchen dann wurden die mitgebrachten körbe ausgepackt und alles vor der haustür dem garten gegenüber serviert",
		"ich öffnete die augen und versuchte zu sehen aber ich fühlte nur wie über mir ein trübes leuchten",
		"es war im spätsommer unsre familie saß in der ligusterlaube beim nachmittagskaffee wozu außer dem alten syndikus auch der kammerjunker sich eingefunden hatte",
		"es ist grausam sagte sie kopfschüttelnd so eine familie",
		"ein solcher sonntagnachmittag nachdem schon einige jahre in dieser weise vorübergegangen waren ist mir besonders im gedächtnis geblieben ich hatte mich in dem angenehmen bewußtsein des feiertages in unserm hofe umhergetrieben und war endlich in das waschhaus gelangt das am ende desselben lag",
		"wieb rief sie was sagt sie",
		"so lieblich hatte ich sie mir nicht gedacht und doch war sie dieselbe noch nur ihre augen schienen dunkler geworden und die linien des zarten profils waren ein wenig schärfer gezogen als vor jahren",
		"kind sagte sie besorgt der doktor hat s dir ja verboten",
		"auch anne lene hatte ihr teil bekommen aber man wußte kaum waren es spottreden oder unbewußte huldigungen denn alles bezog sich am ende doch nur auf den gegensatz ihres zarten wesens zu der derben und etwas schwerfälligen art des landes",
		"ich sah durch die lücken des fußbodens das vom mond beleuchtete wasser glitzern und faßte anne lenes kleid um sie zurückzuhalten",
		"der kammerjunker ohne sie weiter zu beachten haschte eine mücke die eben an ihm vorüberflog",
		"denn mir ist als habe an jenen sonntagnachmittagen immer die sonne geschienen und als sei die luft über dieser endlosen grünen wiesenfläche immer voll von lerchengesang gewesen",
		"ich glaube noch jetzt daß von dieser kleinen ermahnung sich der fast scheue respekt her schreibt den ich solange sie lebte vor dieser frau behalten habe doch schon faßt wieb mich bei der hand und führt uns weit umher auf den sonnigen steigen zuletzt bis zur graft hinunter an der ein gerader steig entlang führt",
		"da er sich meines vaters als geschäftsbeistandes bediente und keine weiteren bekanntschaften in der stadt hatte so war er in unserm hause ein oft gesehener gast geworden",
		"sie hatte ihr gesicht zu mir gewandt und sah mich traurig an mitleidig ich weiß noch jetzt nicht ob mit mir oder mit sich selbst",
		"rief sie und verzog ihren mund daß das blendende gebiß zwischen den lippen hervortrat",
		"marten sagte anne lene zu dem hofmann halte das pferd marten",
		"und der arme junge rutschte von seinem stuhl und schlich sich schweigend wieder von dannen",
		"als ich in das gesindezimmer trat sah ich indessen nur die alte wieb welche eifrig an ihrem strickstrumpf arbeitete",
		"ich trat zu ihr",
		"ei schöne mamsell sagte sie indem sie einen tiefen knicks vor ihr machte und mit einer abscheulichen koketterie ihre durchlöcherten röcke schwenkte haben sie keine angst meine lumpen sind alle gewaschen",
		"ein menuett marx und fügte sie lächelnd hinzu nicht wahr freund simon darf dabeisein",
		"aber das süße gefühl die nachmittagsfeier so ganz unangebrochen vor mir zu haben ließ mich immer noch zögern ins haus hinabzugehen",
		"weshalb denn nicht",
		"etwa zwei jahre später um ostern kehrte ich als junger doctor promotus in die heimat zurück",
		"und wie oft sind wir diesen weg gegangen",
		"nach einer weile bemerkte ich einen mann an der seite des deiches herabsteigen und uns auf dem fußwege entgegengehen",
		"mach dein kompliment vor den damen",
		"schrie ich und streckte die hände nach dem graben zu",
		"da fühlte ich eine hand sich schwer auf meine schulter legen und eine stimme rief marx marx was macht ihr da",
		"wir gingen also hinein ich machte meine reverenz vor anne lenes großmutter und trank um mich schon jetzt meiner zierlichen partnerin würdig zu zeigen meinen kaffee mit besonderer behutsamkeit",
		"hier suchte ich wieder atem zu gewinnen und wiederholte dann noch einmal meinen versuch es war vergebens",
		"ich blieb noch eine weile bei ihr und allmählich wurde sie ruhiger",
		"bist du denn das nicht mehr",
		"ich bemerkte dies eigentlich erst als sie eines tages mit veränderter frisur ins zimmer trat",
		"auf anne lenes antlitz drückte sich ein erstaunen aus als sei sie durch diese worte wie von etwas völlig unmöglichem betroffen worden",
		"anne lene ging mit den mädchen in den garten hinab und aus dem fenster sah ich wie sie die blumen von den jasminbüschen und von den rot blühenden himbeersträuchen brachen",
		"sie nickte freundlich und wir gingen aus dem saal nach ihrem zimmer um ein umschlagtuch für sie zu holen ich fühlte wohl damals schon daß sie sorge um anne lenes gesundheit mich nicht allein zu jener bitte veranlaßt hatte denn als wir die treppe zu dem dunkeln flur hinabstiegen war mir als wenn ich mit einem glücklich geraubten schatz ins freie flüchtete",
		"mein vater war der geschäftliche beistand der alten frau ratmann van der roden gehe ich rückwärts mit meinen gedanken und suche nach den plätzen die von der erinnerung noch ein spärliches licht empfangen so sehe ich mich als etwa vierjährigen knaben mit meinen beiden eltern auf einem offenen wagen über den ebenen marschweg dahinfahren ich fühle plötzlich den sonnenschein mit einem kühlen schatten wechseln der an der einen seite von ungeheuren bäumen auf den weg hinausfällt und während ich meinen kleinen kopf über die lehne des wagenstuhle recke um den breiten graben zu sehen der sich neben den bäumen hinzieht biegen wir gerade in die schatten hinein und durch ein offenstehendes gittertor",
		"er hat die alte heuberg niederreißen lassen und ein modernes wohnhaus an die stelle gesetzt",
		"einige tage darauf fand das leichenbegängnis statt mit aller feierlichkeit patrizischen herkommens so wie die verstorbene es bei lebzeiten in allen punkten selbst verordnet hatte",
		"nach einer weile bewegte sie die hand ein wenig so daß das papier von der flamme des neben ihr auf dem tische stehenden lichtes ergriffen wurde",
		"es kam uns eine dumpfe luft entgegen als wir die tür des alten prunkgemaches geöffnet hatten",
		"wir standen auf einem freien platze vor dem alten gartenpavillon dessen türen offen in den zerbrochenen angeln hingen",
		"sie schalt auf die bettlerin und redete dies und das von allgemeinen dingen indem sie ihre rauhe hand liebkosend über das haar ihres lieblings hingleiten ließ",
		"freilich die seidenen bändchen sind längst davon und die strümpfe die hat dein großvater selig mir ausgezogen aber wenn dir die schuhe noch gefällig sind",
		"bleib sie nur mamsell sagte das weib und ließ die empfangene münze in die tasche gleiten ich gehe schon es ist hier doch nichts mehr zu finden",
		"sie hatte mich nicht kommen sehen da sie den rücken gegen den weg kehrte und als ich unvermerkt ihre harte hand erfaßte vermochte sie mich erst nicht zu erkennen",
		"als wir oben in den saal getreten waren ging ich in die ecke zu dem kleinen drees und bestellte ein menuett",
		"meine kleider deren ich keines abgeworfen zwangen mich auf die oberfläche zurückzukehren",
		"hatten wir uns etwas verspätet so trafen wir ihn wohl schon auf unserm wege draußen auf den fennen seinen unzertrennlichen begleiter den springstock auf der schulter und während anne lene auf dem fußbrett um die hecken ging lehrte er mich nach landesweise über die gräben zu setzen",
		"aber ein menuett anne lene",
		"meine mutter während wir hin und her schassierten uns näherten und verneigten sah schon lange nicht mehr auf ihre tasten auch sie wie ihr sohn schien die augen nicht abwenden zu können von der kleinen schwebenden gestalt die in graziöser gelassenheit die touren des alten tanzes vor ihr ausführte",
		"der zum bergen des heues bestimmte raum im innern des hauses wovon das hofgebäude in unsern marschen die eigentümlich hohe bildung des daches und seinen namen heuberg oder hauberg erhalten hat es ist volle sonntagsstille um mich her",
		"wartet",
		"er blätterte in seinen büchern umher aber er hatte den alten tanz nicht mehr darin wir mußten uns mit einem walzer begnügen",
		"dann sahen wir durch die erblindeten fensterscheiben nach dem zärtlichen schäferpaar hinüber das noch immer wie vor jahren auf der mitte der wand im grase kniete und rüttelten vergebens an den türen welche von der alten wieb sorgfältig verschlossen gehalten wurden denn der fußboden drinnen war unsicher geworden und hier und dort konnte man durch die ritzen in den dielen auf das darunter stehende wasser sehen",
		"es war schon spätnachmittags als ich den staatshof erreichte",
		"rief peters",
		"drinnen im gesindezimmer fand ich anne lene vor ihrer alten wärterin auf den knien liegen den kopf in ihren schoß gedrückt",
		"ich kam noch nicht meine augen hafteten noch an dem weißen sommerkleidchen an der himmelblauen schärpe und zuletzt an einem alten fächer den sie in der hand hielt",
		"greif zu goldkind rief sie greif zu",
		"etwas später sehe ich die gesellschaft auf den geschlungenen gartenwegen zwischen den blühenden büschen promenieren die alte dame mit der fräse welche am arme meines vaters geht beugt sich zu mir niedere und sagt indem sie mir den kopf aufrichtet du muß dich immer hübsch gerade halten kind",
		"auf dem staatshof theodor storm ich kann nur einzelnes sagen nur was geschehen nicht wie es geschehen ist ich weiß nicht wie es zu ende ging und ob es eine tat war oder nur ein ereignis wodurch das ende herbeigeführt wurde",
		"als wir auf die werfte kamen fanden wir die alte wieb in zank mit einer bettlerin vor der haustür stehen die sie vergeblich abzuweisen suchte",
		"meine hausarbeiten für das gymnasium wurden von meinem vater noch strenger überwacht als sonst und anne lene war außer ihren schulstunden meist unter der aufsicht der mutter beschäftigt",
		"gewöhnlich kam und der alte marten in sonntäglich weißen hemdärmeln schon vor dem tore entgegen und reichte uns in seiner schweigsamen art die hand er konnte es nicht lassen nach seinen jungen gästen auszusehen",
		"ich bat meine alte freundin mir eine streu in ihrer stube aufzuschütten und schlenderte während dies geschah in den garten hinaus",
		"mir waren die blanken braunen augen dieses menschen vom ersten augenblick an zuwider gewesen und auch jetzt noch schienen sie mir nichts gutes zu versprechen",
		"sie ließ dann wohl den faden durch anne lenes finger gleiten und zeigte uns die glätte und feinheit desselben denn wie sie mit später einmal vertraute es sollte aus dem flachse den sie sonntags spann das brautlinnen für ihre junge herrschaft gewebt werden aber es duldete uns nicht lange neben ihr wir ruhten nicht bis sie uns ihr großes schlüsselbund eingehändigt hatte in dessen besitze wir dann die dunkle treppe nach dem oberen stockwerk hinaufstiegen und eine nach der andern die türen zu den verödeten zimmern aufschlossen in denen die feuchte marschluft schon längst an decken und wänden ihren zerstörungsprozeß begonnen hatte",
		"als ich aufsah stand anne lene in der tür",
		"es hat ausgedient sagte sie die schönen schäferpaare wollen sich auch empfehlen",
		"ich sehe noch das gras im sonnenscheine funkeln und fernab um uns her die zerstreuten gehöfte mit ihren weißen gebäuden in der klaren sommerluft",
		"als der kaffee vorüber war stiegen die besten kletterer unter uns in den gipfel der beiden alten linden die zu den seiten des hoftores standen indem jeder das ende eines ungeheueren taues mit sich hinaufnahm",
		"bald aber horchte ich nur dem geräusch der kleinen füße die in einiger entfernung so leicht vor mir dahinschritten",
		"rief sie und wandte sich nach mir um",
		"wollen wir uns aufhalten",
		"wir traten einander gegenüber und ich machte mein kompliment wie der tanzmeister es mich gelehrt hatte",
		"hast du ihn denn so geliebt anne lene",
		"da der hof nur eine halbe stunde von der stadt lag so war uns ein für allemal erlaubt sonntags nach tische dort hinauszugehen",
		"wen meint sie wieb",
		"bald aber änderte er sein verfahren er zog die feder zurück und führte sie wie zum stoß wiederholt gegen die brust der kreatur welche mit den feinen füßen die auf sie eindringende spitze vergebens abzuwehren strebte",
		"am sonnabendnachmittag stellte ich mich regelmäßig ein um die frau ratmann mit der kleinen anne lene zum sonntag auf den kaffee einzuladen was bis zur letzten zeit vor ihrem absterben ebenso regelmäßig von ihr angenommen wurde",
		"und wie ich eine weile regungslos daliege sehe ich durch die lose mich bedeckenden halme wie sie ihr köpfchen zu mir niederbeugt und wie sie dann plötzlich kehrtmacht und sich zu einer alten bäuerin hinarbeitet die mit einem strickstrumpf in der hand uns gegenübersitzt",
		"aber noch als ich das gittertor hinter mir zugeworfen hatte und wieder auf die werfte hinaufging hörte ich sie ihre leidenschaftlichen verwünschungen ausstoßen",
		"sagte die eine musik",
		"von oben schallte das scharren der tanzenden im anstoßenden stalle hörte ich wie täglich um diese zeit den hofmann den karren und die übrigen geräte für die nacht an ihren platz bringen",
		"ich trat in den flur und blickte durch die glasscheiben der stubentür aber ich gewahrte niemanden",
		"wir andern gingen ins haus und besichtigten oben den tanzsaal",
		"anne lene stand vor mir ich sah in der schwachen beleuchtung wie die röte ihr in die schläfe hinaufstieg",
		"vor dem hause welches sie einige straßen von dem unsern entfernt bewohnte standen granitne pfeilersteine die durch schwere eiserne ketten miteinander verbunden waren",
		"wieb machte miene anne lene ins haus zu ziehen",
		"die alte faßte mich unter den arm und zog mich gewaltsam an den rand der graft hinunter",
		"ich habe nicht von mir zu reden",
		"während meiner freistunden nahmen die eigentlichen knabenspiele einen immer größeren raum ein und ich habe meine kleine freundin nie bewegen können unser räuberspiele mitzumachen oder auch nur in dem türkischen zelte platz zu nehmen das ich von alten teppichen in der spitze eines birnbaumes aufgeschlagen hatte",
